  # Use 1 of the following GPUs depending on availability. No preference.
  # To view other GPU types use the following commands:
  # `sky show-gpus`, `sky show-gpus -a`
  accelerators: {"A40": 2} # , A10, A10g, A100-80GB-SXM}
  # To configure single-node, multi-gpu (N GPUs) training, do the following:
  # 1. Set `accelerators:` above to something like this: {"A40": N}
  # 2. Set `num_processes: N` in configs/accelerate/sample_fsdp.yaml
