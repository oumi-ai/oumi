  # To view other GPU types use the following commands:

  accelerators: {"A100"}  # "A100-80GB-SXM", "H100-80GB-SXM"
  # To configure single-node, multi-gpu (N GPUs) training, do the following:
  # 1. Set `accelerators:` above to something like this: {"A40": N}
  # 2. Set `--nproc-per-node N` in the `run:` command at the bottom of the file.
