# RLVR (RL from Verifiable Rewards) training config with judge panel.
#
# This config demonstrates GRPO training with a panel of LLM judges.
# Multiple judges evaluate each completion, and scores are aggregated
# for more robust reward signals.
#
# Panel benefits:
#   - Reduced variance from individual judge biases
#   - More robust evaluation through aggregation
#   - Ability to combine different model perspectives
#   - Support for specialized judges (e.g., one for tone, one for accuracy)
#
# Requirements:
#   - Log into WandB (`wandb login`) or disable `enable_wandb`
#   - Set OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable (for OpenAI judges)
#
# Usage:
#   oumi train -c configs/examples/grpo_rlvr/train_panel.yaml
#

#   - Judge panel config: configs/examples/grpo_rlvr/judge_panel.yaml
