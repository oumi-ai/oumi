  # LLM Judge: Adherence Quality
  # Custom conversation-level evaluation for customer service adherence assessment
  - id: llm_judge
    instance_id: adherence_quality
    params:
      prompt: |
        Evaluate how accurate this customer service adherence assessment is (0-10).

        Context: This is a customer service quality assurance task. The assistant evaluates whether an AI agent's proposed action adheres to standard operating procedures (SOPs) and playbooks.

        CONVERSATION FORMAT:
        The conversation below contains three parts:
        1. SYSTEM: Instructions for evaluating adherence (ADHERENT vs NON_ADHERENT)
        2. USER: Contains GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS, PLAYBOOK DETAILS, CONVERSATION TRANSCRIPT, and AGENT PROPOSED OUTPUT
        3. ASSISTANT: Adherence evaluation with reasoning and classification (ADHERENT or NON_ADHERENT)

        ⚠️ IMPORTANT: The assistant's evaluation is at the VERY END of the conversation (after "ASSISTANT:").
        Look for the JSON response with "reasoning" and "classification" fields.

        Conversation to evaluate:
        {text}

        Evaluation criteria for adherence quality:
        - Does the classification correctly identify if the agent's proposed output adheres to GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS?
        - Does the classification correctly identify if the agent's proposed output adheres to PLAYBOOK DETAILS?
        - Is the reasoning clear and accurate (explains why ADHERENT or NON_ADHERENT)?
        - Does the reasoning stay within the 50-word limit as specified?
        - Is the JSON format correct with both "reasoning" and "classification" fields?

        Scoring guide:
        - 10: Perfect evaluation, correct classification, clear reasoning, proper format
        - 7-9: Good evaluation, mostly correct with minor issues
        - 4-6: Mediocre evaluation, some errors in classification or reasoning
        - 1-3: Poor evaluation, significant errors or missing required fields
        - 0: Invalid or completely wrong evaluation

        Examples of good vs bad:
        Good (score 9-10):
          AGENT PROPOSED OUTPUT: Correctly follows playbook step
          ASSISTANT: {"reasoning": "Agent follows Step 2 correctly...", "classification": "ADHERENT"}  ← Correct

        Bad (score 1-3):
          AGENT PROPOSED OUTPUT: Skips required playbook step
          ASSISTANT: {"reasoning": "Agent follows procedure...", "classification": "ADHERENT"}  ← Should be NON_ADHERENT

        Respond with JSON:
        - "score": 0-10 (10 = maximally accurate adherence evaluation)
        - "label": "very_accurate", "accurate", "somewhat_accurate", "inaccurate"
        - "reasoning": brief explanation of why this evaluation is/isn't accurate

    params:
      prompt: |
        Evaluate this assistant's adherence evaluation response (0-10).

        Context: The assistant must evaluate customer service agent adherence by providing a JSON response with reasoning and classification.

        Assistant response to evaluate:
        {text}

        Evaluation criteria:
        - Does it follow the required JSON format with "reasoning" and "classification" fields?
        - Is the classification one of the valid values (ADHERENT or NON_ADHERENT)?
        - Is the reasoning concise (50 words or less as specified)?
        - Is the reasoning clear and relevant to the classification?
        - Is the JSON properly formatted (valid JSON syntax)?

        Good examples:
        {"reasoning": "Agent correctly follows Step 2 of playbook...", "classification": "ADHERENT"}
        {"reasoning": "Agent skipped required verification step...", "classification": "NON_ADHERENT"}

        Bad examples:
        - Missing "reasoning" or "classification" fields
        - Invalid classification value (e.g., "ADHERENT_MAYBE")
        - Reasoning exceeds 50 words
        - Invalid JSON syntax
        - Empty or malformed response

        Respond with JSON:
        - "score": 0-10 (10 = perfect format compliance)
          * 10: Perfect JSON format, valid classification, concise reasoning
          * 7-9: Good format with minor issues
          * 4-6: Missing fields or format errors
          * 1-3: Significant format violations
          * 0: Completely wrong or missing format
        - "label": "excellent", "good", "needs_improvement", "poor"
        - "reasoning": brief explanation
