  # LLM Judge: Helpfulness
  # Custom conversation-level evaluation for banking intent classification helpfulness
  - id: llm_judge
    instance_id: helpfulness
    params:
      prompt: |
        Evaluate how helpful this banking intent classification is (0-10).

        Context: User asks a banking question, assistant classifies it into one of 77 intent categories (by ID number).

        CONVERSATION FORMAT:
        The conversation below contains three parts:
        1. SYSTEM: Instructions and the full list of 77 intent categories with their IDs
        2. USER: The banking query to classify
        3. ASSISTANT: The classification result (a single numeric ID 0-76)

        ⚠️ IMPORTANT: The assistant's classification is at the VERY END of the conversation (after "ASSISTANT:").
        Look for the last line starting with "ASSISTANT:" to find the classification ID.

        Conversation to evaluate:
        {text}

        Evaluation criteria for helpfulness:
        - Does the classification ID seem appropriate for the user's query?
        - Would this classification lead to helpful downstream actions?
        - Is it the most relevant intent among potential options?
        - Does the assistant provide ONLY the ID (good format)?

        Scoring guide:
        - 10: Perfect classification, highly relevant to query, correct format
        - 7-9: Good classification, reasonable fit for the query
        - 4-6: Mediocre, somewhat relevant but not ideal
        - 1-3: Poor classification, wrong intent for the query
        - 0: No classification or completely wrong

        Examples of good vs bad:
        Good (score 9-10):
          USER: "My card was declined at the store"
          ASSISTANT: 25  ← (ID 25 = declined_card_payment, highly relevant)

        Bad (score 1-3):
          USER: "My card was declined at the store"
          ASSISTANT: 0   ← (ID 0 = activate_my_card, wrong intent)

        Respond with JSON:
        - "score": 0-10 (10 = maximally helpful classification)
        - "label": "very_helpful", "helpful", "somewhat_helpful", "not_helpful"
        - "reasoning": brief explanation of why this classification is/isn't helpful for the user's query

  # LLM Judge: Response Quality

  - id: llm_judge
    instance_id: response_quality
    params:
      prompt: |
        Evaluate this assistant's classification response (0-10).

        Context: The assistant must classify a banking query by responding with a single intent ID (0-76).

        Assistant response to evaluate:
        {text}

        Evaluation criteria:
        - Is it a single numeric ID (0-76)?
        - Is the format correct (just the number, no extra text)?
        - Does it appear to be a reasonable classification for a banking query?

        Good examples: "59", "0", "42" (single numbers)
        Bad examples: "activate_my_card" (label instead of ID), "I think it's 59" (extra text), "" (empty)

        Respond with JSON:
        - "score": 0-10 (10 = perfect classification response)
          * 10: Valid ID (0-76), correct format
          * 5-9: Valid ID but could be better formatted
          * 1-4: Invalid format or out of range
          * 0: Empty or completely wrong
        - "label": "excellent", "good", "needs_improvement", "poor"
