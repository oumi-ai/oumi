    "### Preface\n",
    "Before diving into this tutorial, lets discuss the hierarchy of the LeMa Launcher. At this point, it's worth reading through our tutorial on [Running Jobs Remotely](https://github.com/openlema/lema/blob/main/notebooks/LeMa%20-%20Running%20Jobs%20Remotely.ipynb) to better understand the end-to-end flow of the launcher. Already read it? Great!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "At a high level, the LeMa Launcher is composed of 3 tiers of objects: `Clouds`, `Clusters`, and `Clients`. The Launcher holds an instance of each unique `Cloud`. These `Clouds`, in turn, are responsible for creating compute `Clusters`. And `Clusters` coordinate running jobs. All communication with remote APIs happens via the `Client`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Clouds\n",
    "A Cloud class must implement the [`BaseCloud`](https://github.com/openlema/lema/blob/main/src/lema/core/types/base_cloud.py) abstract class. The Launcher will only create one instance of each Cloud, so it's important that a single Cloud object is capable of turning up and down multiple clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find several implementations of Clouds [here](https://github.com/openlema/lema/tree/main/src/lema/launcher/clouds).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Clusters\n",
    "A Cluster class must implement the [`BaseCluster`](https://github.com/openlema/lema/blob/main/src/lema/core/types/base_cluster.py) abstract class. A cluster represents a single instance of hardware. For a custom clusters (such as having a single super computer), it may be the case that you only need 1 cluster to represent your hardware setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find several implementations of Clusters [here](https://github.com/openlema/lema/tree/main/src/lema/launcher/clusters).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Clients\n",
    "Clients are a completely optional but highly encouraged class. Clients should encapsulate all logic that calls remote APIs related to your cloud. While this logic could be encapsulated with your Cluster and Cloud classes, having a dedicated class for this purpose greatly simplifies your Cloud and Cluster logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find several implementations of Clients [here](https://github.com/openlema/lema/tree/main/src/lema/launcher/clients)."
