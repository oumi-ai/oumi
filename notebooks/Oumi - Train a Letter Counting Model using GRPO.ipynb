    "🚀 Oumi is a fully open-source platform that streamlines the entire lifecycle of foundation models - from [data preparation](https://oumi.ai/docs/en/latest/resources/datasets/datasets.html) and [training](https://oumi.ai/docs/en/latest/user_guides/train/train.html) to [evaluation](https://oumi.ai/docs/en/latest/user_guides/evaluate/evaluate.html) and [deployment](https://oumi.ai/docs/en/latest/user_guides/launch/launch.html). Whether you're developing on a laptop, launching large scale experiments on a cluster, or deploying models in production, Oumi provides the tools and workflows you need.\n",

The following demonstrates how to open a VSCode instance backed by a GCP node with 4 A100 GPUs, from which the notebook can be run.
