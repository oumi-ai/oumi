# Clean System Prompt Solution

## Problem
The original implementation had system prompt logic scattered across multiple handlers with deduplication checks, leading to:
- Duplicate system messages breaking role alternation
- Complex conditional logic throughout the codebase  
- System prompts added at wrong positions in conversations
- Inconsistent handling across different API endpoints

## Clean Solution

### 1. Centralized System Prompt Initialization
System prompts are now handled exactly once during session creation:

```python
# In WebChatSession.__init__:
def __init__(self, session_id: str, config: InferenceConfig, system_prompt: Optional[str] = None):
    self.conversation_history = []
    
    # Initialize conversation with system prompt if provided
    if system_prompt:
        self.conversation_history.append({
            "role": "system",
            "content": system_prompt,
            "timestamp": time.time()
        })
```

### 2. Session Factory Integration
The session factory passes system prompts during creation:

```python
# In get_or_create_session:
if session_id not in self.sessions:
    self.sessions[session_id] = WebChatSession(session_id, self.config, self.system_prompt)
```

### 3. Removed Duplicate Logic
Eliminated all duplicate system prompt injection logic from:
- ✅ OpenAI API handler
- ✅ WebSocket chat handler  
- ✅ Session-based conversation building
- ✅ Fallback conversation creation
- ✅ Regeneration logic
- ✅ Another conversation building method

### 4. Updated Regeneration Processing
Modified regeneration logic to properly handle system messages from conversation history:

```python
# Now processes system messages from history:
if msg.get("role") == "system":
    conversation_messages.append(Message(role=Role.SYSTEM, content=msg.get("content", "")))
```

## Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**: System prompts are added exactly once during session initialization
2. **Proper Ordering**: System messages are always first in conversation history
3. **No Duplication**: Eliminates complex deduplication logic throughout codebase
4. **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns - session initialization vs. message processing
5. **Consistent Behavior**: All API endpoints now behave identically
6. **Role Alternation**: Maintains proper user/assistant alternation after system messages

## Result
- System prompts are integrated exactly once at conversation start
- No more role alternation errors
- Cleaner, more maintainable code
- Consistent behavior across all handlers

This approach follows the principle of handling system prompts as conversation metadata that's established once during initialization, rather than being repeatedly injected during processing.
