"""Clouds module for the OUMI (Open Unified Machine Intelligence) library.

This module provides implementations for various cloud platforms that can be used
with the OUMI launcher for running and managing jobs.

Example:
    >>> from oumi.launcher.clouds import LocalCloud
    >>> local_cloud = LocalCloud()
    >>> local_cloud.run_job(job_config)

Note:
    Ensure that you have the necessary credentials and configurations set up
    for the cloud platform you intend to use.
