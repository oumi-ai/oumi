Oumi is a community-first, end-to-end platform for advanced AI research and development. It provides comprehensive support for foundation model workflows - from pretraining and post-training, to data curation, synthesis, and evaluation. Built with enterprise-grade quality and reliability, Oumi serves both researchers pushing the boundaries of AI and organizations building production-ready solutions.

## Features

Oumi is designed to be fully flexible yet easy to use:

- **Run Anywhere**: Train and evaluate models seamlessly across environments - from local machines to remote clusters, with native support for Jupyter notebooks and VS Code debugging.

- **Comprehensive Training**: Support for the full ML lifecycle - from pretraining to fine-tuning (SFT, LoRA, QLoRA, DPO) to evaluation. Built for both research exploration and production deployment.

- **Built for Scale**: First-class support for distributed training with PyTorch DDP and FSDP. Efficiently handle models up to 405B parameters.

- **Reproducible Research**: Version-controlled configurations via YAML files and CLI arguments ensure fully reproducible experiments across training and evaluation pipelines.

- **Unified Interface**: One consistent interface for everything - data processing, training, evaluation, and inference. Seamlessly work with both open models and commercial APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Vertex AI).

- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily add new models, datasets, training approaches and evaluation metrics. Built with modularity in mind.

- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive test coverage, detailed documentation, and enterprise-grade support make Oumi reliable for both research and production use cases.
