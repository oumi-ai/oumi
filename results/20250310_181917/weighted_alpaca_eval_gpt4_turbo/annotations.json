    "instruction":"Hi, my sister and her girlfriends want me to play kickball with them. Can you explain how the game is played, so they don't take advantage of me?",
    "output_1":"Kickball is a fun and simple game that is similar to baseball or softball, but instead of hitting a ball with a bat, players kick a rubber ball. Here's how the game is typically played:\n\n**Equipment and Setup:**\n- A large rubber ball (similar to a playground ball).\n- A field with four bases arranged like a diamond (home plate, first base, second base, third base).\n- Teams can vary in size, but 8 to 11 players per team is common.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe objective of kickball is to score more runs than the opposing team by kicking the ball and running around the bases to reach home plate.\n\n**Basic Rules:**\n1. **Teams:** There are two teams \u2013 the kicking team and the fielding team. The teams switch roles after each inning.\n\n2. **Kicking Order:** The kicking team has a lineup that determines the order in which players kick the ball.\n\n3. **Pitching:** The pitcher from the fielding team rolls the ball towards home plate. The ball must be rolled smoothly (no bouncing) and within reach of the kicker.\n\n4. **Kicking:** The kicker attempts to kick the ball and then run to at least first base. The kicker must kick the ball within the kicking box (an area including and surrounding home plate).\n\n5. **Outs:** A player can be put out in several ways, similar to baseball:\n   - **Catch:** If the fielding team catches the ball in the air after it has been kicked (before it touches the ground), the kicker is out.\n   - **Tag:** If a fielder tags a runner with the ball while the runner is not on a base, the runner is out.\n   - **Force Out:** If a fielder has control of the ball and touches the base that a runner is forced to run to before the runner gets there (similar to a force out in baseball), the runner is out.\n   - **Strikeouts:** A kicker can also strike out if they miss the ball three times or if they kick the ball foul on the third strike.\n\n6. **Running the Bases:** After kicking the ball, the runner attempts to safely reach a base. Runners can be tagged out by the fielding team or forced out when the fielding team tags the base ahead of the runner.\n\n7. **Scoring Runs:** A run is scored when a runner successfully kicks the ball and then touches all four bases in order, ending at home plate.\n\n8. **Innings:** An inning consists of both teams having a turn to kick and field. Each team's turn continues until they get three outs, after which the other team gets to kick.\n\n9. **Foul Balls:** A kick that lands in foul territory (outside the first or third-base lines) is considered a foul ball. Two fouls count as a strike, and a third foul may result in a strikeout, depending on the rules you are playing with.\n\n10. **Game Length:** The game typically lasts for a set number of innings (often five or seven) or until a time limit is reached.\n\nRemember that kickball is often played casually, and the rules can vary depending on the group you're playing with. Make sure to clarify any specific rules with your sister and her friends before you start playing. Most importantly, have fun and enjoy the game!",
