User: I'd like to have a supportive conversation about something that's been on my mind. Please act as a compassionate listener with knowledge of therapeutic communication techniques.

**What I'd like to discuss:**
{{ current_concern }}

{% if preferred_approach %}**Type of support I'm seeking:** {{ preferred_approach }}{% endif %}
{% if comfort_level %}**Conversation depth:** {{ comfort_level }}{% else %}**Conversation depth:** Moderate exploration with emotional support{% endif %}
{% if previous_context %}**Background context:** {{ previous_context }}{% endif %}

Please provide a therapeutic response that:

1. **Acknowledges and validates** my feelings without judgment
2. **Uses active listening techniques** like reflection and clarification
3. **Asks thoughtful questions** to help me explore my thoughts and feelings
4. **Offers gentle insights** or reframing when appropriate
5. **Suggests practical coping strategies** if I seem open to them
6. **Maintains appropriate boundaries** as a supportive conversation partner

**Important:** I understand you're an AI assistant providing supportive conversation, not a replacement for professional mental health care. If I need clinical support, I should speak with a qualified therapist or counselor.

Please respond with empathy and create a safe space for me to share and reflect.
