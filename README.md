### Everything you need to build state-of-the-art foundation models, end-to-end.

Oumi is a fully open-source platform that streamlines the entire lifecycle of foundation models - from data preparation and training to evaluation and deployment. Whether you're experimenting on a laptop or deploying models in production, Oumi provides the tools and workflows you need.

With Oumi, you can:

- üöÄ Train and fine-tune models from 10M to 405B parameters using state-of-the-art techniques (SFT, LoRA, QLoRA, DPO, and more)
- ü§ñ Work with both text and multimodal models (Llama, Qwen, Phi, and others)
- üîÑ Synthesize and curate training data with LLM judges
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Deploy models efficiently with popular inference engines (vLLM, SGLang)
- üìä Evaluate models comprehensively across standard benchmarks
- üåé Run anywhere - from laptops to clusters to clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP, Lambda, and more)
- üîå Integrate with both open models and commercial APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Vertex AI, Parasail, ...)

All with one consistent API, production-grade reliability, and all the flexibility you need for research.

## Usage

### Installation

Installing oumi in your environment is straightforward:

```shell
# Install the package (CPU & NPU only)
pip install oumi  # For local development & testing

# OR, with GPU support (Requires Nvidia or AMD GPU)
pip install oumi[gpu]  # For GPU training

# To get the latest version, install from the source
pip install git+https://github.com/oumi-ai/oumi.git
```

For more advanced installation options, see the [installation guide](https://oumi.ai/docs/latest/get_started/installation.html).


### Oumi CLI

You can quickly use the `oumi` command to train, evaluate, and infer models using one of the existing [recipes](/configs/recipes):

```shell
# Training
oumi train -c configs/recipes/smollm/sft/135m/quickstart_train.yaml

# Evaluation
oumi evaluate -c configs/recipes/smollm/evaluation/135m/quickstart_eval.yaml

# Inference
oumi infer -c configs/recipes/smollm/inference/135m_infer.yaml --interactive
```

For more advanced options, see the [training](https://oumi.ai/docs/latest/user_guides/train/train.html), [evaluation](https://oumi.ai/docs/latest/user_guides/evaluate/evaluate.html), [inference](https://oumi.ai/docs/latest/user_guides/infer/infer.html), and [llm-as-a-judge](https://oumi.ai/docs/latest/user_guides/judge/judge.html) guides.

### Running Jobs Remotely

You can run jobs remotely on cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP, Lambda, etc.) using the `oumi launch` command:

```shell
# GCP
oumi launch up -c configs/recipes/smollm/sft/135m/quickstart_gcp_job.yaml

# AWS
oumi launch up -c configs/recipes/smollm/sft/135m/quickstart_aws_job.yaml

# Azure
oumi launch up -c configs/recipes/smollm/sft/135m/quickstart_azure_job.yaml

# Lambda
oumi launch up -c configs/recipes/smollm/sft/135m/quickstart_lambda_job.yaml
```

## Why use Oumi?

If you need a comprehensive platform for training, evaluating, or deploying models, Oumi is a great choice.

Here are some of the key features that make Oumi stand out:

- üîß **Zero Boilerplate**: Get started in minutes with ready-to-use recipes for popular models and workflows. No need to write training loops or data pipelines.
- üè¢ **Enterprise-Grade**: Built and validated by teams training models at scale
- üéØ **Research Ready**: Perfect for ML research with easily reproducible experiments, and flexible interfaces for customizing each component.
- üåê **Broad Model Support**: Works with most popular model architectures - from tiny models to the largest ones, text-only to multimodal.
- üöÄ **SOTA Performance**: Native support for distributed training techniques (FSDP, DDP) and optimized inference engines (vLLM, SGLang).
- ü§ù **Community First**: 100% open source with an active community. No vendor lock-in, no strings attached.
