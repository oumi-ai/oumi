      "First, I need to recall the document content. From the context provided, there are several figures and tables discussing the framework. Figure 9 mentions a funnel process where the number of bugs decreases through stages, and the filtered fail-to-pass@1 rate increases. The initial set is 174 bugs with a baseline pass@1 rate of 11.29%. The abstention policy reduces this to 39 bugs, increasing the fail-to-pass@1 rate to 21.5%. Then, combined validation policies further refine it. The combined-binary policy leaves 33 bugs with a 29% rate. More aggressive filters like combined-p75 and combined-p90 narrow it down to 25 and 12 bugs, with rates of 35% and 53% respectively. \n",

      "So the combination of abstention and validation reduces the number of bugs, which increases the quality of the patches shown to developers. The performance improvements are the increases in the filtered fail-to-pass@1 rate at each stage. The answer should mention the stages and the corresponding rates. Also, the document mentions that validation using percentile thresholds (p75 and p90) provides better improvements than binary judgment, especially for certain bug types. \n",
      "\n",
      "I need to make sure to reference the specific numbers from the figures and tables. For example, Figure 9 shows the progression from 174 to 39 to 33, 25, 12 bugs with the corresponding rates. Also, Table 2 and Table 3 might have more data, but the user's question is about the framework's combination, so focusing on Figure 9 and the related text is key. \n",
      "\n",
      "The answer should explain that abstention first filters out less promising bugs, then validation further refines the set, leading to higher quality patches. The specific improvements are the increases in the filtered fail-to-pass@1 rate at each stage. Also, mention that more aggressive validation (p75 and p90) leads to higher rates but with fewer bugs. \n",
      "\n",
      "I need to check if the document mentions any specific performance metrics beyond the rates. For example, in Figure 10 and 11, there are mentions of filtered-accept@k improvements, but the main question is about the dual-policy framework's stages. The answer should focus on the funnel stages and the corresponding performance metrics. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, the answer should outline the stages: initial set (174 bugs, 11.29%), after abstention (39 bugs, 21.5%), then combined policies leading to 33 (29%), 25 (35%), and 12 (53%) bugs. The improvement is the increase in the filtered fail-to-pass@1 rate.

The most selective configuration (combined-p90) achieves the highest **53%** filtered fail-to-pass@1 rate, though it sacrifices volume, highlighting the trade-off between precision and the number of bugs attempted.  \\n\\n**Citations:**  \\n- Figure 9 [1] describes the funnel process and metrics.  \\n- Table 2 [2] and Figure 10 [3] provide specific improvements for sanitizer and NPE bugs.  \\n- Text discussing validation thresholds and bug types [4].  \\n\\n[1] Figure 9: \"progressively narrowing the set to increase the quality of patches shown to a developer.\"  \\n[2] Table 2: \"validation-p90 improves filtered-accept@1 by +24% over regression checks.\"  \\n[3] Figure 10: \"validation-p90 results in improvements to filtered-accept@1 of +8% and +24%.\"  \\n[4] Text: \"validation-p90 performs worse than the spec-based variant at 90th percentile.\"' role=<Role.ASSISTANT: 'assistant'>\n"

      "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know how the dual-policy framework combines abstention and validation to improve patch quality and the specific performance improvements at different stages.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to recall the document content. From what I remember, the document discusses a dual-policy approach where abstention and validation are used together. The abstention policy filters out less promising bugs, while validation further refines the remaining patches. \n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at Figure 9, it mentions that the process is visualized as a funnel. Starting with 174 bugs, the baseline pass@1 rate is 11.29%. The abstention policy reduces this to 39 bugs, increasing the filtered fail-to-pass@1 rate to 21.5%. Then, combined validation policies further refine it. The combined-binary policy leaves 33 bugs with a 29% rate. More aggressive filters like combined-p75 and combined-p90 narrow it down to 25 and 12 bugs, respectively, with higher rates of 35% and 53%. \n",
      "\n",
      "The user is asking about the improvement in patch quality and the specific numbers at each stage. So, the answer should outline each stage's bug count and the corresponding filtered fail-to-pass@1 rates. Also, mention how each step contributes to quality by reducing noise and increasing the rate. \n",
      "\n",
      "I need to make sure the numbers are correctly attributed to each policy. The combined-p90 has the highest rate at 53%, which is a significant improvement from the baseline. Also, the document mentions that validation using percentile thresholds (p75 and p90) provides better improvements than binary judgment. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another point is that the abstention policy is based on the overall quality of the bug report, while validation focuses on the success of the attempt. Combining them allows for a balance between volume and precision. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should structure the answer by first explaining the combination's effect on quality, then list the stages with their respective bug counts and performance metrics. Also, note the trade-offs between the number of bugs and the precision of the patches. \n",
      "\n",
      "Check if there are any other relevant parts. The table in Figure 11 talks about different bug types and their filtered-accept@k, but the question is about the framework's overall performance. So focus on the funnel stages and the metrics mentioned in Figure 9. \n",
      "\n",
      "Make sure to cite the relevant sections, like Figure 9 and the descriptions around it. Also, mention that the combined policies progressively narrow down the bugs, leading to higher filtered fail-to-pass rates, which indicates better patch quality.\n",

      "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know how the dual-policy framework combines abstention and validation to improve patch quality and the specific performance improvements at different stages.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to recall the document content. From what I remember, the document discusses a dual-policy approach where abstention and validation are used together. The abstention policy filters out less promising bugs, while validation further refines the remaining patches. \n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at Figure 9, it mentions that the process is visualized as a funnel. Starting with 174 bugs, the baseline pass@1 rate is 11.29%. The abstention policy reduces this to 39 bugs, increasing the filtered fail-to-pass@1 rate to 21.5%. Then, combined validation policies further refine it. The combined-binary policy leaves 33 bugs with a 29% rate. More aggressive filters like combined-p75 and combined-p90 narrow it down to 25 and 12 bugs, respectively, with higher rates of 35% and 53%. \n",
      "\n",
      "The user is asking about the improvement in patch quality and the specific numbers at each stage. So, the answer should outline each stage's bug count and the corresponding filtered fail-to-pass@1 rates. Also, mention how each step contributes to quality by reducing noise and increasing the rate. \n",
      "\n",
      "I need to make sure the numbers are correctly attributed to each policy. The combined-p90 has the highest rate at 53%, which is a significant improvement from the baseline. Also, the document mentions that validation using percentile thresholds (p75 and p90) provides better improvements than binary judgment. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another point is that the abstention policy is based on the overall quality of the bug report, while validation focuses on the success of the attempt. Combining them allows for a balance between volume and precision. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should structure the answer by first explaining the combination's effect on quality, then list the stages with their respective bug counts and performance metrics. Also, note the trade-offs between the number of bugs and the precision of the patches. \n",
      "\n",
      "Check if there are any other relevant parts. The table in Figure 11 talks about different bug types and their filtered-accept@k, but the question is about the framework's overall performance. So focus on the funnel stages and the metrics mentioned in Figure 9. \n",
      "\n",
      "Make sure to cite the relevant sections, like Figure 9 and the descriptions around it. Also, mention that the combined policies progressively narrow down the bugs, leading to higher filtered fail-to-pass rates, which indicates better patch quality.\n",
      "</think>\n",
