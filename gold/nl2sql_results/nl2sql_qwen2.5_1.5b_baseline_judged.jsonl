It seems you're trying to query data, where fields representing sim_id are related. To find average duration, we first need to get all simulations, then select those with a duration greater than the average duration of all simulations. And since we're sorting by duration, we need to put the duration into a rank, theoretically.\nHere is the SQL statement that should work based on the provided schema:\n\n```sql\nWITH avg_duration AS (\n    SELECT \n        AVG(run_duration) AS avg_duration \n    FROM \n        simulations\n),\nsimulations_with_duration_above_avg AS (\n    SELECT \n        s.sim_id, \n        s.run_duration, \n        s.run_duration - (SELECT avg(run_duration) FROM simulations_with_duration_above_avg) x_diff\n    FROM \n        simulations s\n    WHERE \n        s.run_duration NOT IN (SELECT run_duration \n                                FROM ranker)\n),\nranked_simulations AS (\n    SELECT \n        sim_id,\n        run_duration,\n        x_diff\n    FROM \n        simulations_with_duration_above_avg\n)\nSELECT \n    code_id,\n    version,\n    COUNT(sim_id) AS num_simulations,\n    avg(run_duration) OVER () AS total_avg,\n    avg(run_duration) OVER (PARTITION BY code_id ORDER BY x_diff DESC) AS avg_against_average\nFROM \n    ranked_simulations\nJOIN \n    simulation_codes sc \nON \n    sc.sim_id = ranked_simulations.sim_id AND sc.code_id = sc.code_id\nAND \n    sc.run_duration NOT IN (SELECT run_duration\n                           FROM ranker)\nGROUP BY \n    code_id,\n    version, \n    run_duration \nORDER BY \n    avg_against_average DESC;\n```\n\nIn this sql code, we first calculate the average run_duration for all simulations (looking at the overall data, that is using the close parenthesis in your overall creation). Then we get simulations that have run durations that NOT equal to that average. For each simulation, we subtract its duration from the average, calculating a difference between its duration and the average run duration for that simulation.\n\nThen we group the records by simulation code and version, and count the number of simulations.\n\nLastly, we calculate the average of these new sums, which is an average run duration for each simulation code-version, in order to display it sorted, presented in a descending order.\n\nPlease be advised that without a real external knowledge about your target schema or starting point, there is no way to be pointing to the specific SQL operations or syntax.

The final answer will need to aggregate results based on the ranking of these turbines.\n\nConditional aggregation will be applied later to select the top 10 turbines.\n</think>\n\n<answer>5</answer>\n\nTo find the number of turbines in the top 10 based on the highest energy production, the lowest number of breakdowns, and the lowest maintenance costs, let's first identify which turbines meet the criteria using the subqueries:\n\n1. **Highest Energy Production:** Turbine with the highest energy production.\n2. **Lowest Number of Breakdowns:** Turbine with the lowest number of breakdowns.\n3. **Lowest Maintenance Costs:** Turbine with the lowest maintenance costs.\n\nWe need to ensure that we are ranking the turbines correctly for energy production, maintenance cost, and number of breakdowns. We will then select the top 10 turbines based on these highest values.\n\nThe `RANK` function in SQL will rank the turbines based on their performance in these attributes, and we will use the `GROUP BY` clause with the appropriate conditions to get the top 10 turbines for each criterion.\n\nThe rank of the turbine will be based on its ranking in terms of energy production. The rank in terms of breakdowns will consider the number of unique burst(s) per turbine. The rank in maintenance costs will consider the average cost of the trips.

Filter the results to include only stocks that have active alerts (i.e., `enabled` = 1).\n3. Use the `historical_prices` table to fetch the latest closing prices for these stocks.\n4.

And return the final equation and answer in <answer> </answer> tags, for example <answer> 2019 </answer>.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "<think> \nTo find the product category with the highest average price, we need to calculate the average price for each category. \nSince we need to find the category with the highest average price and also require a check for the number of verified purchase reviews, it's easier if we first group the products by category and get the average prices. Then, for each category, we compare these average prices to find the maximum group. \nAfter fetching the maximum price from the grouped query, we should also check to see if that category matches the category with the most verified purchase reviews. This means we need to sum the number of verified purchase reviews for each category and then use a subquery or a CASE WHEN statement to identify the category with the maximum verified purchase reviews.\n\nFor a maximum single result (category with the highest average price and confirmed by verified purchases), this 2-step approach won't work in SQL directly. Instead, we might need to either:\n- Write a `MAX` for the 2 items and use MAX(AVG) for the second item in each group.\n- Create unique identifier for the category with highest average price and compare.\n- Use PostgreSQL's window functions to derive such a unique key.\n</think> \n\nConsider this ALTERNATIVE query:\n```sql\nWITH categorized_products (average_price) AS (\n    SELECT AVG(price) as avg_price \n    FROM products \n    GROUP BY category_id \n    ORDER BY avg_price DESC\n)\n-- In the below query, a maximum(average_price) filter is used to get the max value from a set of tuples,\n-- then check if it matches the category with the max number of verified purchases.\n-- However, there's a problem here. \n-- In SQL without a window function, we can't group by `category_id` in the main query \n-- and use SUM() and WHERE clause simultaneously for maximum() query.\nSELECT category_name\nFROM categories \nJOIN categorized_products on categorized_products.category_id = categories.category_id \nWHERE categorized_products.avg_price = (SELECT MAX(avg_price) FROM categorized_products GROUP BY avg_price)\n```\n\nplease note: `WITH ... AS` only runs one time during query parsing. Therefore, it can make the optimization of query plan. So it often makes the query faster. However, it does not have a visible effect on performance when run the query.\n\nThen run these two commands:\n\n```sql\nSELECT SUM(verified_purchase) FROM products GROUP BY category_id\n```\n\nto get all category sums, and clarify which category you want.\n\nFinally, we'd have to use `CASE WHEN` or `SUBQUERY` to do the task, but that is tricky and planning on case of performance.\n\nSo the final query in postgreSQL will look like below, be careful, you need give it all column names, or it will return column `1, 2, 3, 4` instead of just `category_name`.\n\n```sql\nWITH categorized_products (average_price) AS (\n    SELECT AVG(price) as avg_price \n    FROM products \n    GROUP BY category_id \n    ORDER BY avg_price DESC\n), category_sum (category_id as id, sum) AS (\n    SELECT category_id, SUM(verified_purchase) FROM products GROUP BY category_id\n)\nSELECT category_name \nFROM categories \nJOIN categorized_products\nON categorized_products.category_id = categories.category_id\nJOIN category_sum \nON categories.category_id = category_sum.id\nWHERE categorized_products.avg_price = (SELECT MAX(avg_price) FROM categorized_products GROUP BY avg_price)\nHAVING sum(category_sum.sum) = (SELECT MAX(sum) FROM category_sum)\n```", "role": "assistant"}], "metadata": {"ground_truth": "WITH CategoryAveragePrice AS (\n    SELECT \n        p.category_id, \n        AVG(CAST(p.price AS REAL)) AS average_price\n    FROM \n        products p\n    GROUP BY \n        p.category_id\n),\nVerifiedCategoryReviews AS (\n    SELECT \n        p.category_id, \n        COUNT(r.review_id) AS total_verified_reviews\n    FROM \n        products p\n    JOIN \n        reviews r ON p.product_id = r.product_id\n    WHERE \n        r.is_verified_purchase = 1\n    GROUP BY \n        p.category_id\n)\nSELECT \n    c.category_name\nFROM \n    categories c\nJOIN \n    CategoryAveragePrice cap ON c.category_id = cap.category_id\nJOIN \n    VerifiedCategoryReviews vcr ON c.category_id = vcr.category_id\nORDER BY \n    cap.average_price DESC, \n    vcr.total_verified_reviews DESC\nLIMIT 1;", "extracted_sql": "", "edit_distance": 1.0, "exact_match": 0}}

This means we should join the `properties`, `activities`, `activity_types`, and potentially other tables like `users` to filter and count the activities. Let's create a series of SQL `SELECT` queries to achieve this.\n\n1. **Group activities by `property_id` and count them**:\n```sql\nSELECT \n    p.property_id,\n    p.address,\n    p.city,\n    p.state,\n    p.zip,\n    p.bedrooms,\n    p.bathrooms,\n    p.square_footage,\n    p.year_built,\n    p.property_type\nFROM properties AS p\nJOIN (\n    SELECT \n        property_id,\n        COUNT(*) as activity_count\n    FROM activities \n    GROUP BY property_id\n    ORDER BY activity_count DESC\n    LIMIT 1\n) AS activity_count_query\nON p.property_id = activity_count_query.property_id;\n```\n\nThis query first finds the property ID with the most activities by joining `activities` with a subquery that counts activities per property and orders these counts in descending order.

First, identify what information is needed: we need to know how many musicians play in a specific song called \"Flash\".\n\n2. In our SQL database, we need to join tables that relate to the presence of musicians in songs. Specifically, we need to:\n   - The instruments table to count unique musicians (D). \n   - The Vocals table to count wizards (E) and curates the artists per songs (G).\n   - The Performance table, exclusively to count artistos per individual commits (J).\n\n3. Next, we join these tables to ensure we count each musician/artists based on their roles and presence in the song. We will use a LEFT JOIN to gather all song information.\n\n4. In the result we get, we ignore duplicate musicians to count unique ones.\n\n5. We add the result of two counts:\n   - The first count comes from the JOIN between Vocals and Performance tables.\n   - The second count comes from joining the Vocals table itself.\n\n6. Finally, we sum these counts to get the total number of musicians/artists per song.\n\nThis query setup notably assumes joining and conditional aggregation needs to happen. Adjustments should be made in case the inputs or structure of the database or tables is altered; this approach also ignores song collaborations and crew, focusing solely on a specific song's musicians/artists rather than all song artists.\n\nThus, encapsulating everything into an equation:\n\nfinal_count = (\n    (SELECT COUNT(*)\n    FROM Vocals V\n    INNER JOIN Performance P ON V.SongId = P.SongId\n    GROUP BY V.SongId)\n    +\n    (SELECT COUNT(*)\n    FROM Vocals\n    GROUP BY Vocals.SongId)\n);\n\nThe final count gives us the total number of musicians/artists who contribute to \"Flash\".", "role": "assistant"}], "metadata": {"ground_truth": "SELECT count(*) FROM performance AS T1 JOIN band AS T2 ON T1.bandmate  =  T2.id JOIN songs AS T3 ON T3.songid  =  T1.songid WHERE T3.Title  =  \"Flash\"", "extracted_sql": "", "edit_distance": 1.0, "exact_match": 0}}
