{"idx": 8, "gt": "Total (value), Total (loan)", "raw_content": "<think>\nTo determine the components used to tabulate the Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, we need to understand its definition. The LTV ratio is defined as Vessel values divided by net borrowings on the vessels. \n\nFrom the table, \"Vessel values including newbuildings (broker values)\" represents the vessel values. \n\nFor net borrowings, we should look at the components that relate to borrowings and adjust for any components that would reduce or increase the net borrowings. The table provides \"Borrowings\" as the primary component, but to find net borrowings, we should also consider \"Cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash\" as it reduces the net amount borrowed.\n\nTherefore, the components involved in calculating the LTV ratio are \"Vessel values including newbuildings (broker values)\" for the vessel values and \"Borrowings\" minus \"Cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash\" for the net borrowings.\n\nGiven the formula: LTV = Vessel values / Net borrowings, and substituting the components from the table, we get LTV = Vessel values including newbuildings / (Borrowings - Cash and cash equivalents).\n\nHowever, since the table directly provides a \"Total (loan)\" which seems to consolidate various loan-related figures but doesn't directly match our identified components for net borrowings, we need to adjust our understanding based on what's directly calculable from the provided data. The \"Total (loan)\" might not be directly usable as it appears to be a consolidation of different loan aspects, not purely the net borrowings relevant for the LTV calculation as per the definition.\n\nConsidering the direct definition and components provided, the equation based on the identified components would ideally be LTV = Vessel values / (Borrowings - Cash and cash equivalents). Yet, the calculation in the table seems to imply using \"Total (loan)\" for the denominator, which may include or exclude certain adjustments like \"Loans receivables\" or the specific \"- Hereof debt regarding Land and buildings & Other plant and operating equipment\" without clear indication of how these affect the net borrowing figure directly in calculation.\n\nBut according to the definition given, if we consider \"Vessel values including newbuildings (broker values)\" as the numerator and aim to find the denominator which is \"net borrowings\" and given that \"Borrowings\" is the primary figure with adjustments needed, we notice \"Total (loan)\" might already account for these adjustments indirectly.\n\nThus, focusing strictly on the provided definition and aiming to match it with table data directly: The LTV ratio is essentially about dividing the total vessel value by the net debt (or borrowings adjusted for cash, which reduces debt). However, without explicit net borrowings calculation provided in the table that matches our initial breakdown, and considering the complexities around the \"Total (loan)\" figure, we simplify our approach based on directly given data that can be used for such a calculation.\n\nFor accuracy in matching the given definition with the table's content, and recognizing the possibility that \"Total (loan)\" consolidates necessary adjustments for net borrowings (despite the initial interpretation suggesting a more detailed breakdown), the most straightforward approach based on the table's structure would use \"Vessel values including newbuildings (broker values)\" and the provided \"Borrowings\" figure, adjusted for cash, as the core components. But since \"Total (loan)\" is given and seems to serve a consolidative role, our simplified equation reflecting the direct data provided and aiming for clarity in calculation would consider the vessel values and the concept of net borrowings as represented in the table's structure.\n\nGiven this, the calculation simplifies to using the vessel values and the figure that represents the net impact of borrowings, which the table seems to consolidate under \"Total (loan)\" for the purpose of calculating ratios like LTV, even though our step-by-step breakdown aimed to clarify the components involved based on the definition provided.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer> LTV = Vessel values including newbuildings (broker values) / (Borrowings - Cash and cash equivalents) or more directly from the table, LTV = Total (value) / Total (loan) </answer>", "pred_extracted": "LTV = Vessel values including newbuildings (broker values) / (Borrowings - Cash and cash equivalents) or more directly from the table, LTV = Total (value) / Total (loan)", "status": "equal", "method": "judge", "judge": {"decision": "equal", "confidence": 0.92, "rationale": "Prediction explicitly states the same formula (LTV = Total (value) / Total (loan)) and adds an equivalent expanded description; meaning is unchanged.", "raw": {"model_text": "{\"decision\":\"equal\",\"confidence\":0.92,\"rationale\":\"Prediction explicitly states the same formula (LTV = Total (value) / Total (loan)) and adds an equivalent expanded description; meaning is unchanged.\"}", "parsed": {"decision": "equal", "confidence": 0.92, "rationale": "Prediction explicitly states the same formula (LTV = Total (value) / Total (loan)) and adds an equivalent expanded description; meaning is unchanged."}}, "error": null}}

However, when we refer to the \"beginning balance\" in general, it's likely we're looking for the gross figure since that represents the total amount before considering recoveries from reinsurers.\n\nThe table provides us with the following information for 2018:\n- Beginning balance: $738.7 million\n- Less: recoverable from reinsurers: $(136.4) million\n- Beginning balance, net: $602.3 million\n\nGiven the question asks for the beginning balance, we should consider what is typically meant by this term in the context of the table. The beginning balance in its most basic form, without adjustments for recoveries, is what's usually of interest for understanding the initial state of reserves.\n\nTherefore, the beginning balance in 2018, before any adjustments for recoveries from reinsurers, is $738.7 million.\n</think>\n\n<answer> $738.7 million </answer>", "pred_extracted": "$738.7 million", "status": "mismatch", "method": "judge", "judge": {"decision": "not_equal", "confidence": 0.92, "rationale": "The values differ greatly in magnitude and units: ground truth is $243.5 (no 'million'), prediction is $738.7 million (~$738,700,000), so they are not equivalent.", "raw": {"model_text": "{\n  \"decision\": \"not_equal\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.92,\n  \"rationale\": \"The values differ greatly in magnitude and units: ground truth is $243.5 (no 'million'), prediction is $738.7 million (~$738,700,000), so they are not equivalent.\"\n}", "parsed": {"decision": "not_equal", "confidence": 0.92, "rationale": "The values differ greatly in magnitude and units: ground truth is $243.5 (no 'million'), prediction is $738.7 million (~$738,700,000), so they are not equivalent."}}, "error": null}}

We can find the increase in research and development expenses between 2017 and 2018, and between 2018 and 2019. \nThe increase in research and development expenses between 2017 and 2018 was $1.7 billion or 13%. \nThe increase in research and development expenses between 2018 and 2019 was $2.2 billion or 15%. \nLet's assume the research and development expenses in 2017 were x. \nThen, the research and development expenses in 2018 would be x + $1.7 billion, and in 2019 would be (x + $1.7 billion) + $2.2 billion.\nHowever, since we do not have the base value of the research and development expenses for any year, we cannot directly calculate it from the given information.

Price declines: The market environment was highly competitive, leading to price declines, which would also contribute to a decrease in Adjusted EBITA.\n3.

{"idx": 862, "gt": "16", "raw_content": "<think>\nTo find the total federal tax expense between 2017 to 2019, we need to analyze the given table. The table provides details about the current provision for income taxes and the deferred tax expense (benefit) for federal and foreign taxes. \n\nFirst, let's identify the federal tax components. The current provision for income taxes does not explicitly mention federal taxes, but it does provide state and foreign taxes. Therefore, we can infer that the federal tax is included in the total current provision but not directly stated. \n\nHowever, the deferred tax expense (benefit) section does mention federal taxes. For the years 2017, 2018, and 2019, the federal deferred tax expenses (benefits) are $26, $(13), and $3, respectively.\n\nSince the question asks for the total federal tax expense, and given that we don't have direct information on the current federal tax provision, we will focus on the deferred tax expense for federal taxes provided. \n\nThe total federal deferred tax expense from 2017 to 2019 can be calculated by summing the federal deferred tax expenses for each year: $26 (2017) + $(13) (2018) + $3 (2019).\n\nBut to get the actual federal tax expense, we also need to consider the portion of the total current provision that is federal. Since the table does not provide a direct breakdown of current federal tax, we will assume that the total provision for income taxes includes both current and deferred taxes. The difference between the total provision for income taxes and the total deferred tax expense might give us an insight into the current tax provision, which includes federal, state, and foreign taxes.\n\nHowever, without explicit numbers for the current federal tax provision, we can't directly calculate the total federal tax expense including both current and deferred components. The question seems to be pointing towards using the information given about the deferred tax expense as the primary source for federal tax expenses.\n\nGiven the information and the typical understanding of tax provisions, the calculation we can perform based on the provided data is the sum of the federal deferred tax expenses: $26 + (-$13) + $3.\n\nThis calculation yields $16 as the total federal deferred tax expense from 2017 to 2019. But, remember, this does not include any current federal tax provision, which is not provided in the table.\n\nSince the current provision is not explicitly broken down into federal taxes, and assuming the question seeks the total federal tax expense based on the information given (which might be a misunderstanding since current federal tax is not provided), the equation to calculate the known federal tax component (deferred) would be:\n\n$26 (2017 federal deferred) + (-$13) (2018 federal deferred) + $3 (2019 federal deferred) = $16\n\nThis approach only accounts for the deferred federal tax expense, as the current federal tax expense is not directly provided in the table.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer> $16 </answer>", "pred_extracted": "$16", "status": "equal", "method": "judge", "judge": {"decision": "equal", "confidence": 0.95, "rationale": "Both represent the same numeric value (16); the prediction adds a dollar sign but does not change the numeric equivalence.", "raw": {"model_text": "{\n  \"decision\": \"equal\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.95,\n  \"rationale\": \"Both represent the same numeric value (16); the prediction adds a dollar sign but does not change the numeric equivalence.\"\n}", "parsed": {"decision": "equal", "confidence": 0.95, "rationale": "Both represent the same numeric value (16); the prediction adds a dollar sign but does not change the numeric equivalence."}}, "error": null}}

Similarly, the difference between June 30, 2017, and June 30, 2018, can help us find the amortization for 2018.\n\nGiven data:\n- Accumulated amortization for June 30, 2019: $500.2 million\n- Accumulated amortization for June 30, 2018: $406.2 million\n- Amortization for the year ended June 30, 2019: $95.1 million\n- Amortization for the year ended June 30, 2018: $97.2 million\n- Amortization for the year ended June 30, 2017: $80.0 million\n\nSince the accumulated amortization increases by the amount of amortization each year, we can calculate the accumulated amortization for June 30, 2017, by subtracting the amortization for 2018 from the accumulated amortization for June 30, 2018, and then further subtracting the amortization for 2017.\n\nAccumulated amortization for June 30, 2018: $406.2 million\nAmortization for 2018: $97.2 million\nSo, the accumulated amortization for June 30, 2017, would be $406.2 million - $97.2 million = $309.0 million.\n\nHowever, to ensure consistency with the provided data and to directly answer the question, let's calculate it step by step considering the information given.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the increase in accumulated amortization from 2018 to 2019:\n$500.2 million (2019) - $406.2 million (2018) = $94 million\n\nThis increase should roughly match the amortization expense for 2019, which is $95.1 million, considering rounding.\n\nNow, to find the accumulated amortization for June 30, 2017:\nAccumulated amortization for June 30, 2018: $406.2 million\nAmortization for the year ended June 30, 2018: $97.2 million\n\nThus, the accumulated amortization for June 30, 2017, is:\n$406.2 million - $97.2 million = $309 million\n\nGiven the amortization for 2017 was $80.0 million, to find the accumulated amortization as of June 30, 2017, we consider the direct subtraction method based on the provided annual amortization amounts.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer> $309 million </answer>", "pred_extracted": "$309 million", "status": "mismatch", "method": "judge", "judge": {"decision": "not_equal", "confidence": 0.93, "rationale": "Ground truth is the plain number 309; prediction states \"$309 million\", adding a currency and a million-scale multiplier, which changes the value and units.", "raw": {"model_text": "{\"decision\":\"not_equal\",\"confidence\":0.93,\"rationale\":\"Ground truth is the plain number 309; prediction states \\\"$309 million\\\", adding a currency and a million-scale multiplier, which changes the value and units.\"}", "parsed": {"decision": "not_equal", "confidence": 0.93, "rationale": "Ground truth is the plain number 309; prediction states \"$309 million\", adding a currency and a million-scale multiplier, which changes the value and units."}}, "error": null}}

The equation for the percentage of freehold properties externally valued during the year would be (0.38x + 31) / x = 0.51, because 38% of the existing freehold properties plus the 31 newly acquired ones, divided by the total number of freehold properties, equals 51%.\n\nThis equation simplifies to 0.38x + 31 = 0.51x.\n\nSubtracting 0.38x from both sides gives us 31 = 0.13x.\n\nDividing both sides by 0.13 gives us x = 238.46.\n\nSince x must be a whole number (it represents the total number of freehold investment properties), and rounding is not explicitly discussed in the provided information, we assume x is approximately 238.\n\nThe number of freehold properties externally valued would then be 51% of this total, but since we are directly given that 31 properties were externally valued as part of the acquisitions, and the question asks for the number of freehold investment properties on which the Group has obtained external valuations including these, we consider the 51% as a given fact to find the total, not the specific number externally valued.\n\nSo, if 51% of 238 is the number externally valued, then 0.51 * 238 = 121.38, but we were looking for how many freehold properties in total were externally valued in the year, knowing 31 were from new acquisitions.\n\nTherefore, we need to correct our approach based on what the question directly asks, which is the number of freehold investment properties externally valued, knowing 31 were new acquisitions, and we have the percentage of total freehold properties externally valued.\n\nGiven the correct understanding that we need the total number externally valued and knowing 31 new ones were added, the question might actually directly relate to how many were externally valued in total, considering the information provided about percentages and new acquisitions.\n\nThus, to find the total number of freehold properties externally valued, including the 31 new ones, considering the 51% external valuation rate, we would calculate the total number of freehold properties first, which was not directly provided but can be inferred from the percentage increase due to new acquisitions.\n\nHowever, the key piece of information is recognizing the question asks for the number of properties externally valued, not the total number of freehold properties. Since we have the percentage that represents the externally valued properties (51%) and know this includes the 31 new properties, the confusion arises from calculating the total number of properties versus the number externally valued.\n\nTo directly answer the question based on the given percentages and information: the Group obtained external valuations on 31 freehold investment properties acquired during the year, and the total percentage of freehold properties externally valued is 51%, which implies the rest of the calculation is to understand how these numbers fit into the overall valuation percentages provided.\n\nBut, to simplify and correct the approach directly to the question: the Group has obtained external valuations on the 31 freehold properties as part of the acquisitions, and the question does not require calculating the total number of freehold properties to answer how many were externally valued, as the 51% includes these 31 in its total count.\n\nThe clarification directly leads to recognizing that the number of freehold investment properties on which the Group has obtained external valuations, based on the provided text and focusing on the question, does not necessarily require calculating the total number of freehold properties but understanding the given data about external valuations.\n\nTo find the total number externally valued, we consider the 51% rate. But since we know 31 properties were externally valued from new acquisitions, and this is part of the 51% total, the actual question seems to be directly answered by the information given about new acquisitions and the overall external valuation percentage.\n\nThe final step is recognizing that to find the number of freehold investment properties externally valued, we consider the information provided about the external valuations, including the new acquisitions.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer> 121 </answer>", "pred_extracted": "121", "status": "mismatch", "method": "judge", "judge": {"decision": "not_equal", "confidence": 0.99, "rationale": "The predicted numeric answer (121) does not match the ground-truth numeric answer (31); they are different values.", "raw": {"model_text": "{\n  \"decision\": \"not_equal\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.99,\n  \"rationale\": \"The predicted numeric answer (121) does not match the ground-truth numeric answer (31); they are different values.\"\n}", "parsed": {"decision": "not_equal", "confidence": 0.99, "rationale": "The predicted numeric answer (121) does not match the ground-truth numeric answer (31); they are different values."}}, "error": null}}

According to the text, the consideration exchanged for Automated was $445.7 million in cash, and the preliminary opening balance sheet includes $58.2 million of assumed liabilities in connection with a deferred incentive compensation plan for Automated's European employees.\n\nHowever, looking at the table provided, the total liabilities assumed are actually listed in the \"Liabilities\" section. We can calculate the total liabilities by adding up all the liabilities listed.\n\nTotal liabilities = Accounts Payable + Current portion of long-term debt + Current portion of operating lease liabilities + Other current liabilities + Long-term debt, less current portion + Long-term operating lease liabilities, less current portion + Deferred taxes + Other non-current liabilities\nTotal liabilities = $12.0 + $2.6 + $1.5 + $55.1 + $4.3 + $2.8 + $0.4 + $21.4\n\nBut since this calculation is for the revised preliminary allocation as of December 31, 2019, and we want to know the initial assumed liabilities, we should look at the \"Revised Preliminary Allocation As of August 1, 2019\" column.\n\nTotal liabilities as of August 1, 2019 = $12.0 + $2.6 + $0 + $56.2 + $4.3 + $0 + $0 + $19.8\nTotal liabilities as of August 1, 2019 = $94.9 million\n\nBut this still may not be the correct answer since the question asks for the value of assumed liabilities from Automated. Looking closely, $445.7 million was the total consideration, and if we subtract the total assets acquired from this amount, we should get the total liabilities assumed.\n\nLet's calculate the total assets acquired:\nTotal assets acquired = Cash and cash equivalents + Trade receivables, net + Other receivables + Inventories, net + Prepaid expenses and other current assets + Property and equipment, net + Identifiable intangible assets, net + Goodwill + Operating lease right-of-use-assets + Other non-current assets\nTotal assets acquired as of August 1, 2019 = $16.0 + $37.3 + $0.3 + $40.7 + $2.3 + $79.3 + $78.7 + $261.3 + $0 + $24.7\nTotal assets acquired as of August 1, 2019 = $540.6 million - $5.2 million (adjustments) is not needed here since we are looking at the numbers as of August 1, 2019.\n\nNow, to calculate the assumed liabilities, we subtract the total assets acquired from the total consideration:\nAssumed liabilities = Total consideration - Total assets acquired\nAssumed liabilities = $445.7 million - $540.6 million\n\nThis approach, however, does not yield the assumed liabilities correctly because the total assets acquired exceed the total consideration, indicating that the consideration plus liabilities assumed should equal the assets acquired.\n\nThe correct approach should directly utilize the information given about the assumed liabilities in connection with the deferred incentive compensation plan, but since we are looking for the total assumed liabilities, we should consider all liabilities as of the date of acquisition.\n\nGiven this complexity, the question might actually be answered more directly from the provided text or by understanding that the liabilities are part of the acquisition details, not necessarily requiring a calculation based on the provided table columns.\n\nThe correct calculation considering the information provided should be:\nTotal consideration = Total assets acquired - Total liabilities assumed\n$445.7 million = $540.6 million - Total liabilities assumed\n\nRearranging the equation gives:\nTotal liabilities assumed = $540.6 million - $445.7 million\n\nThis calculation seems to make sense as it directly addresses the relationship between the total consideration, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed.\n\nThus, \nTotal liabilities assumed = $540.6 million - $445.7 million\nTotal liabilities assumed = $94.9 million\n\nThis matches the total liabilities listed in the table as of August 1, 2019, confirming that our approach to directly calculate or consider the liabilities from the given data is consistent.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer> $94.9 million </answer>", "pred_extracted": "$94.9 million", "status": "mismatch", "method": "judge", "judge": {"decision": "not_equal", "confidence": 0.98, "rationale": "Numbers differ substantially: ground truth $58.2M vs predicted $94.9M (difference $36.7M, ~63% higher), so they are not equivalent.", "raw": {"model_text": "{\n  \"decision\": \"not_equal\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.98,\n  \"rationale\": \"Numbers differ substantially: ground truth $58.2M vs predicted $94.9M (difference $36.7M, ~63% higher), so they are not equivalent.\"\n}", "parsed": {"decision": "not_equal", "confidence": 0.98, "rationale": "Numbers differ substantially: ground truth $58.2M vs predicted $94.9M (difference $36.7M, ~63% higher), so they are not equivalent."}}, "error": null}}

{"idx": 1551, "gt": "$ 64,798, $ 35,452", "raw_content": "<think>\nTo find the License and subscription revenue in 2019 and 2018, we first need to understand that the table provides the cost of revenue, not the revenue itself. The cost of license and subscription revenue is given as $64,798 (9% of total revenue) in 2019 and $35,452 (5% of total revenue) in 2018. However, to find the actual license and subscription revenue, we need to use the percentage of total revenue. \n\nLet's denote the total revenue in 2019 as x and in 2018 as y.\n\nIn 2019, the cost of license and subscription revenue is 9% of the total revenue, which means 0.09x = $64,798.\n\nIn 2018, the cost of license and subscription revenue is 5% of the total revenue, which means 0.05y = $35,452.\n\nTo find the total revenue for each year, we can solve these equations:\n\n0.09x = $64,798 => x = $64,798 / 0.09\nx = $719,977 (approximately) for 2019 total revenue related to the cost of license and subscription.\n\n0.05y = $35,452 => y = $35,452 / 0.05\ny = $708,040 for 2018 total revenue related to the cost of license and subscription.\n\nHowever, the task asks for License and subscription revenue, not the total revenue. Since the cost is a part of the revenue, and we do not have a direct formula to calculate the revenue from the given cost without knowing the profit or the total revenue, the best approach based on the provided data would be to directly use the percentages and costs to understand the relationship. \n\nGiven the structure of the question and the provided information, it seems there was an expectation to calculate or derive the revenue figures directly from the given costs and percentages. But, to accurately calculate the \"License and subscription revenue,\" we would need either the total revenue figures for 2019 and 2018 or a clearer relation between the costs and revenues.\n\nSince the table already provides the costs and their percentages of the total revenue, without additional information on how the costs relate to the revenues (e.g., profit margins), we can't accurately calculate the License and subscription revenue for 2019 and 2018 based solely on the provided data.\n\nHowever, the critical oversight in the initial analysis is recognizing that the percentages given (9% and 5%) refer to the cost of license and subscription as a percentage of the total revenue, not the revenue itself. Without explicit total revenue figures or a clearer breakdown of how costs translate to revenues, we must acknowledge the limitation in calculating the exact revenue figures based on the cost data alone.\n\nThe actual question seems to seek a calculation or derivation that isn't fully supported by the information given in the table and text, as it pertains to costs rather than revenues directly.
