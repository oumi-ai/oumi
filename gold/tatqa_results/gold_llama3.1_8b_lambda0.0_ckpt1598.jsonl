However, calculating the sum of acquisitions for those years gives the total for acquisitions during those two years:\n$1,303.6 million (since that is the amount in the 2019 column), it doesn't take into account the 2018 value since 2018 column is actually for 2017-2018 period and 2019 column is 2018-2019.\n</think>\n\n<think>\nThere's been a mix-up in the logic in previous step of calculation. The 2018 Goodwill for Network Software & Systems segment ($33.1 million) actually applies to 2017 (since the table structure shows 2017-2018 acquisition of $33.1, \nand the 2019 column is actually representing 2018-2019 for Network Software & Systems segment acquisition which is $1,303.6 million)\nSo to get the total from 2018 to 2019 for Network Software & Systems segment, \nTotal from 2018-2019 = Goodwill in 2019 column for Network Software & Systems + Goodwill in 2018 column for Network Software & Systems \n\nThis leads to  $1,303.6 million (2019 Acquisition) + $33.1 million (2018 Acquisition) \n$1,303.6 million + $33.1 million = $1,336.7 million \nSo, the correct method leads to adding the years but the table suggests direct addition of two column to account for the change over those years, \nactually meaning the sum of additions.\n\nThink about the original query to simply be asking for total from '2018-2019', this yields a calculation directly using given 2018 and 2019 values without needing further breakdown \nTotal from 2018-2019 = $1,303.6 million + $33.1 million = $1,336.7 million \n\nHowever, it is simpler to just consider the given table directly for Network Software & Systems totals over two years: \n- The actual amount to consider from 2018 (given) = $33.1 million (for 2017-2018, in table) \n- The actual amount from 2017-2018 to 2018-2019 = $1,303.6 million (for 2018-2019, in table)\n\nCombining: $1,303.6 million (2018-2019 acquisition) \n- Add the rest as table's total \n\nHowever, re-check the interpretation of the data – in table each value (like 2018 acquisition $33.1 million for Network Software & Systems) needs to be considered in context of segment year. Since only these two years are relevant (2018-2019 for the calculation of the change in goodwill), \nthink of each year's acquisition added together, but realize each line refers to year segment balances.\n\nThis N allows: Rest of the additions (other years, and full set of segments) aren't considered directly in this one question since it restricts to just Network Software & Systems.

The specific causes given for the 2018 increase relative to 2017 include lower payments for taxes, integration, and restructuring costs, as well as proceeds from the termination of interest rate swaps. These are given as reasons for the increase, but they do not directly cause the identified increase amount when comparing the years, as the payout for interest rate swaps occurred in the previous year, and we're calculating for the change into 2018. \n\nTherefore, when comparing the $242 million increase directly, the text supports the increase being primarily due to several factors including the ones mentioned but does not break down the $242 million explicitly into these components for the calculation. However, for the cause in 2018 that contributed to the overall change relative to 2017 and 2018, focuses on what happened in those years rather than what was specifically mentioned in the increase.\n\nGiven the provided structure, we identify:\n- Lower payments for taxes as one cause mentioned, but without specifying the exact dollar amount attributed to this cause.\n- Lower payments for integration and restructuring costs as another, also without a separately specified dollar amount.\n- Proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps as a factor that impacted 2018 positively but, again, without specifying how this translates directly to the $242 million increase without the adjusting factor mentioned for the prior year's impact.\n\nHowever, based on standard information and focusing on just the question about what caused the increase in 2018 without the detailed breakout given directly in the text but implied to relate to the explanations there provided, we still look for a general approach rather than the precise numeric breakdown for a reason, which isn't divergently provided against the total increase amount asked for. \n\nGiven this context, what seems most connected to the actual query about what caused the increase (since the real specifics given after would break down impacts from prior or face different time frames) is to state that lower costs and favorable income are causes mentioned but not explicitly quantified here for the direct cause of the $242 million increase between 2017 and 2018 without seeing each factor's specific dollar effect.\n\n</think>\n<answer> Lower payments for taxes, integration, and restructuring costs, and proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps. </answer>", "pred_extracted": "Lower payments for taxes, integration, and restructuring costs, and proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps.", "status": "equal", "method": "judge", "judge": {"decision": "equal", "confidence": 0.95, "rationale": "The prediction lists the same causes (lower tax payments, integration and restructuring costs, and proceeds from terminating interest rate swaps) and conveys the same meaning despite minor wording/punctuation differences.", "raw": {"model_text": "{\n  \"decision\": \"equal\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.95,\n  \"rationale\": \"The prediction lists the same causes (lower tax payments, integration and restructuring costs, and proceeds from terminating interest rate swaps) and conveys the same meaning despite minor wording/punctuation differences.\"\n}", "parsed": {"decision": "equal", "confidence": 0.95, "rationale": "The prediction lists the same causes (lower tax payments, integration and restructuring costs, and proceeds from terminating interest rate swaps) and conveys the same meaning despite minor wording/punctuation differences."}}, "error": null}}

However, we should then consider given the direct reference to the question about the costs provided in a direct manner without having detailed figures on specific line items for each year provided, we use the available data for a comparison or a calculation based on increases or decreases provided.\nConsidering the nature of the data and its use for a general question like this and the data structure provided, calculating using the increases or percentages directly reported can help fill in what might seem like missing values based on proportions and changes provided but the readable information does not lead to a calculation directly addressing general administrative expenses without a starting point that can be derived logically from the information given within a specific framework that is directly answerable with numbers provided.\nThus, given the information about increases and their impact on financial metrics without a direct number for general administrative expenses for 2017 provided, and based on the nature of the data and the provided structure and content which contains detailed financial metrics and changes over the years but does not specify the direct general administrative expenses figure for 2017 in a manner to allow for calculation directly in this context using the provided numbers:\n\n\nBased on given data and usual increases:\nSince we can't derive a direct number without further specifics, one might typically turn to a method that considers proportional changes, overall financial metrics, or the specific sectors for clues, but all this and more is based on understanding how costs might influence results and general organizational performance over time.\n\n\nGiven we're asked for a specific value that's not directly provided but would rely on the detailed reporting of various financial aspects which does not include explicit details for 2017 for general and administrative expenses in the question or the data directly tied to solving the query in a direct manner without additional assumptions than given increases or comparisons, let's consider the direct data we can derive and the nature of reporting financial information which might hint at the methodology for finding the value.\n\n\nConsidering we cannot determine the value without making a specific calculation based on the data, but aiming for an accurate accounting for financial data:\nGiven that, and looking at the usual way financials are reported for significant items and the nature of detail provided without losing focus on the question asked:\n\nWe lack the direct number and crucial pieces needed to accurately compute the specific figure without making unaccounted assumptions or further detailed financial breakdowns provided in the question or data that specifically detail general administrative expenses for 2017, considering the usual approach and the data generally related to financial analysis.\n\nHowever, based on the detail that we might know for overall expenses or revenues and how they impact, but given the specific nature of general and administrative expenses and their dynamics within an organization, without explicit values we're hampered in direct computation in this scenario.\n\n\nSo looking closer at the text and again, considering the problem statement and the nature of the answer sought without direct calculation:\n\nWe only have the general and administrative increase from 2017 to 2018 but not the base value for 2017 directly. Yet, for clarity and directness in providing an answer without creating assumptions beyond what's explicitly provided:\n\nSince the value for 2017 isn't directly provided and no specific method leads to a clear answer from the provided text, but to attempt answering directly based on the information provided and in the most straightforward way possible given the best available information without further assumptions or unaccounted factors:\nGiven the increase from 2017 to 2018 and without a base from 2017 directly:\nThe equation to represent the relationship with provided data is general knowledge but lacks a necessary starting point directly in the text:\nWe cannot deduce the answer directly but based on the increase:\n</think>\n\n<answer> Direct calculation not feasible with provided data; however, based on the increase, the question seems to be aiming for the base value, but without the proper starting point, an equation cannot be fully stated as the calculation of the base value when only the increase and a comparative basis for an indirect calculation is considered.</answer>", "pred_extracted": "Direct calculation not feasible with provided data; however, based on the increase, the question seems to be aiming for the base value, but without the proper starting point, an equation cannot be fully stated as the calculation of the base value when only the increase and a comparative basis for an indirect calculation is considered.", "status": "mismatch", "method": "judge", "judge": {"decision": "not_equal", "confidence": 0.95, "rationale": "Ground truth is the numeric value 4277; the prediction says calculation is not feasible and gives no numeric answer, so it does not match.", "raw": {"model_text": "{\n  \"decision\": \"not_equal\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.95,\n  \"rationale\": \"Ground truth is the numeric value 4277; the prediction says calculation is not feasible and gives no numeric answer, so it does not match.\"\n}", "parsed": {"decision": "not_equal", "confidence": 0.95, "rationale": "Ground truth is the numeric value 4277; the prediction says calculation is not feasible and gives no numeric answer, so it does not match."}}, "error": null}}

{"idx": 301, "gt": "29 per cent", "raw_content": "<think> To find out how much Spirent has reduced their total emissions since their 2014 baseline, we need to look at the given text. The total emissions for 2019 are 4,785.7 tonnes of CO2e, and for 2014, they are not provided in the table. However, we are given the total emissions for 2018 as 5,087.6 tonnes of CO2e, and it's also stated that the emissions were reduced by 29% since the 2014 baseline. So, we can calculate the emissions for 2014 by using the percentage reduction. </think>\n\n<think> The percentage reduction is 29%, and the emissions for 2018 are 5,087.6 tonnes. Let's assume x is the total emissions for 2014 and (1-0.29) x is the 29% reduction. So, the equation will be: (1-0.29) x = 5,087.6. Solving this equation, we get x = 5,087.6 / 0.71 = 7,211.39 tonnes. But we actually need to find out the percentage reduction amount. We know the original amount is 2014 baseline emissions and the final emissions are for 2019, which are 4,785.7 tonnes, so to get the actual reductions in tonnes instead of percentage, we would compare the two years but since we are directly given percentage, we stick with that and its given percentage reduction. </think>\n\n<think> However, my previous step to directly calculate 2014 emissions from percentages given was mathematically incorrect because it involved using the total emissions of 2018 directly for calculating baseline emissions, whereas the reduction percentage is actually calculated directly from the baseline to 2019 to calculate the difference in tonnes directly which I'll correct. The correct focus should be on calculating the difference in tonnes directly or focusing on percentage reduction that is given, but we should actually verify how much 29% of 2014's emissions would be. The percentage directly informs us that 29% of 2014's emissions equals the reduction from 2014 to 2019. But since the 2014 figure isn't provided, we need another approach to see how much 29% of an unknown figure is equal to and directly compare to the total reduction since we are to answer by how much the emissions were reduced in tonnes as stated. However, given the equation directly provided: emissions in 2019 = 4,785.7 tonnes and 2018 = 5,087.6 tonnes with a reduction of 29%, to get the baseline (2014), we would actually look at the statement saying emissions dropped by 29% from 2018 to 2019. To properly interpret the percentage reduction and the baseline figure being directly given in the percentage drop from the 2018 level to 2019 level, the text directly shows \"6.14 per cent reduction\" from 2018 to 2019. However, the amount that 29% of our baseline (2014) emissions is equal to is something we can't directly calculate without knowing our baseline emissions or directly given data that is equivalent to these reductions like from a comparison not using provided rounding, thus showing the requirement of a baseline value for 2014 to get an absolute amount, for which we were not provided the quantity to calculate it directly but were directed to work with what was given for 2018 and 2019. Thus, my approach was slightly misinterpreted, but the emission reduction directly given to calculate or reference is based on the amount the baseline reduced to which we can infer by taking the stated reduction percentage and comparing directly the total given figures in the year provided as stated below but should be noted we cannot directly back-calculate absolute values based on the given 29% without knowing our starting (2014 baseline) emissions amount, making a mistake in interpretation regarding the task's requirement based on given data for a full breakdown and acknowledging it without having direct data for calculating from 2014 to 2018's baseline in absolute emissions directly in the prompt, the focus should simply be on the impact of that reduction given the information actually shared for our specific year reductions and the accurate approach to directly referencing the provided narrative to answer the question based on given information and precise data we do not need for an absolute baseline figure calculation here but acknowledge that without it the reference to the total reduction is indeed as given: the stated total emissions for 2019 and 2018 directly give us our percentage decreases without needing to calculate an exact baseline figure based directly on given information for a final comparative understanding and noted error in my prior interpretation approach based on directly given data comparisons rather than needing a specific 2014 baseline amount for full context clarity when only reduction percentage is provided and total emissions for those years are given for comparison which would indeed require one to work out a particular reduction amount or total baseline figure to compare directly, but my direction was slightly misplaced without the baseline, acknowledging that for complete clarity and direct comparison without needing to infer backwards based on given percentages and emission totals for the years provided for a specific calculation of reduction, we must consider what's directly possible from the information given and correct my method to align with the information directly presented in the provided data for clarification.</think>\n\n<think> To directly address the question in terms of stating how much Spirent has reduced their total emissions since their 2014 baseline without the direct baseline figure but noting the information provided and how it applies: the direct statement is that total emissions dropped by 29% since the 2014 baseline, with the specific total for 2019 being 4,785.7 tonnes and 2018 being 5,087.6 tonnes indicating a drop but the actual calculation of this percentage directly refers to a reduction from an unspecified baseline to 2019, with 2018 providing a more direct comparative figure. Given the question's phrasing, the actual numerical reduction is what's directly referenced in terms of how much the total emissions have been reduced since 2014. </think>\n\n<think> The direct information provided for total emissions for 2019 and 2018 gives a clear drop from 2018 to 2019, and without the baseline arising for back-calculation, the percentage drop or a calculated figure directly answering the question is not directly computable based on provided data for a 2014 baseline. The text simply states that emissions dropped by 29% from the 2014 baseline, without giving us the numbers to directly calculate the reduction as stated. The provided data allows for us to see the drop in total emissions but does not allow us to calculate the specific 29% reduction from the baseline without the baseline figure. </think>\n\n<think> Given this misunderstanding in the approach to the solution without direct baseline emissions data for 2014, the direct reference from the information and the problem's aim should be aligned with provided figures and the narrative's intent, which shows a clear reduction over time without the initial figure for a direct calculation of this reduction in tonnes or percentage directly related to the question asked in a manner directly computable from provided information in absolute terms, emphasizing the narrative's focus on the year-over-year reductions as given and the interpretation that should be emphasizing these over individual calculations without the necessary 2014 baseline figure, directly focusing on what's given and the percentage change directly stated in relation to the year change, then focusing on how to interpret the provided data in context.</think>\n\n<think> However, since the direct problem statement aims for a calculation we cannot directly solve with given data in a mathematical equation without knowing the 2014 figure, but we can discuss the formula that might apply. If the total emissions in 2018 were 5,087.6 tonnes, and they dropped by 29%, we should note that without the original (2014) emissions, the original figure is not calculable based on given numbers in a straightforward equation, the only way to directly relate the given percentage drop is to understand the range of the calculation and how direct comparisons might relate to the percentage change from one year to the next without needing a baseline. But for clarity in calculation based on direct percentage change statement: if the 29% drop from 2014 is directly stated to get to 2019 without the starting (2014 figure), we're looking at a direct effect of the change without the base emissions provided in order to see the full extent of the reduction as described. This poses a calculation challenge without a clear baseline figure, but we see the intent of the question to find the absolute or percentage reduction. </think>\n\n<think> To approach the problem with a simplified understanding of the provided data and the narrative's emphasis: a percentage decrease of 29% from 2014 to 2019 tells us the relative change, not the absolute reduction in tonnes without knowing the original amount for a baseline. The information about a reduction and focusing on the narrative about year-over-year changes as stated indicates that the question is asking for an understanding of how these reductions have affected emissions without needing to compute an absolute figure based directly on the 2014 baseline, given data focuses on the change from year to year, using provided data for a general understanding of the reduction without needing baseline data. However, to solve this as intended based on data we are not given is to follow the trajectory of change described for understanding purposes. </think>\n\n<think> Given the question's requirement to find out how much Spirent reduced their total emissions since their 2014 baseline, we should acknowledge that the statement of the 29% drop directly informs us of the change but doesn't provide a direct calculation based on the original figure without knowing it for a definitive numerical answer regarding the baseline year. The interpretation involves a direct statement of a change without needing an exact figure for the starting point for a mathematical equation for a numerical calculation of the drop, resulting in acknowledging a direct information interpretation based on the narrative and year-over-year comparisons provided in the text. However, the reduction as stated is an annual change and does not provide an absolute figure for a specific year over another without directly knowing the baseline number, making the question formulate in a way that does not directly result in a specific numerical answer without the 2014 baseline. </think>\n\n<think> Thus, based on the narrative's statement about year-over-year changes and a reduction of 29%, we know that the actual numerical drop from 2018 to 2019 emissions as reported (not needing to infer or calculate further based on the 29% statement for an absolute figure without the starting baseline) can indeed be interpreted and understood in terms of reduction percentage and the narrative indicating a reduction without needing that baseline for an absolute calculation. However, the request for the reduction as asked (in a mathematical equation based on provided figures directly) cannot be fulfilled without that baseline value, making the narrative about the drop the focus rather than a precise equation. Thus, a way to interpret this is in the context of the provided data's narrative and description, focusing on the year-over-year changes as given, which indeed indicates a reduction but without an absolute figure, results in an interpretation rather than a mathematical calculation based on given data. </think>\n\n<think> Considering the need to follow the instruction and the focus that should be on the year-over-year changes and how the 29% drop relates to that, but without a clear baseline for a total reduction amount in the format requested, one way to approach is to discuss the concept of reduction over time as provided in the text without needing an exact base figure calculation, focusing on the reduction percentage and changes over years but for clarity on the request, the information does not directly give us a way to calculate the decrease in tonnes from a specified year without that year's baseline emissions figure, making it more about understanding the change rather than calculating it in a mathematical equation based directly on provided data without the necessary baseline. To provide a final step in line with the direct request: considering the information as it's presented, a clear and direct answer cannot be produced without more data, but I must follow the necessary format for the calculation, focusing on the provided text's narrative of changes and how reductions are described without needing a specific baseline figure to calculate it in the requested format but still seeking to address the request as formatted. </think>\n\n<think> Reflecting on the given problem's need to answer by how much Spirent reduced their total emissions since their 2014 baseline and the data provided which shows a drop from 2018 to 2019 but does not provide the baseline emissions in 2014 for a numerical calculation, we approach the question with what we have. Given the percentage drop and comparing year-over-year, Spirent indeed showed a reduction, but interpreting the provided narrative in the required format without the baseline figure leads to an understanding of the change in a descriptive manner or year-over-year comparisons. The provided text actually informs of the drop and the total emissions for the years 2018 and 2019, with the narrative indicating a significant reduction from the 2014 baseline but without a direct figure to calculate, leading to the conclusion that the information supports understanding the reduction in the narrative rather than in a direct calculation format without the baseline number for the starting year in question for a final numerical calculation in line with the request. Thus, the question cannot be answered with the absolute reduction as requested in a straightforward manner based on provided information without needing the 2014 baseline figure. </think>\n\n<think> Given the requirement to answer in the format requested and to focus on the information provided about the emissions in 2018 and 2019 without the baseline for a clear calculation, it seems that the best approach to answer the question following the format would be to describe the reduction in terms of year-over-year change and the impact noted in the narrative without being able to calculate the absolute difference in a piece of direct mathematical reasoning, to acknowledge the narrative and the changes without needing the specific absolute numbers for the reduction amount as requested.\n\n<think> Given the prompt and the data provided to focus on a year-over-year comparison and impact, the actual format for answering the question might be more accurately followed by describing the impact of change over the period rather than calculating the absolute reduction with the given data which does not provide a clear starting point for a calculation in the specific format requested.\n\nGiven the narrative provided and the prompt for the answer in a certain format without an absolute baseline figure to calculate an exact numerical reduction:\n\n\nGiven the prompt and the focus on year-over-year impact:\n\n<answer> Since the starting figure of 2014 emissions is not provided, we can't calculate a precise number, but Spirent reduced their total emissions by 29% since their 2014 baseline according to the given data. </answer>", "pred_extracted": "Since the starting figure of 2014 emissions is not provided, we can't calculate a precise number, but Spirent reduced their total emissions by 29% since their 2014 baseline according to the given data.", "status": "equal", "method": "judge", "judge": {"decision": "equal", "confidence": 0.92, "rationale": "The prediction states a 29% reduction, which matches the ground-truth '29 per cent'; the extra commentary about lacking a starting figure does not change the stated percentage.", "raw": {"model_text": "{\n  \"decision\": \"equal\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.92,\n  \"rationale\": \"The prediction states a 29% reduction, which matches the ground-truth '29 per cent'; the extra commentary about lacking a starting figure does not change the stated percentage.\"\n}", "parsed": {"decision": "equal", "confidence": 0.92, "rationale": "The prediction states a 29% reduction, which matches the ground-truth '29 per cent'; the extra commentary about lacking a starting figure does not change the stated percentage."}}, "error": null}}

To find the number of shares vested in 2019, we should look at the change in non-vested shares over this period. The number of non-vested shares increased from 1,187,586 to 1,283,281. The decrease in non-vested shares is given as 12,632. The increase is given as 473,550. However, since we are asked about the total non-vested shares at the end of the year and the shares vested, we need to look at how many shares vested, not how many shares were non-vested at the beginning and end of the year. The vested shares would have decreased the number of non-vested shares, but we also must take into account the other changes and the starting point before the vested shares were added or subtracted from the calculation.\nTo find the exact figure for vested shares in 2019 based on the table provided:\n- Non-vested at the start of the year (December 31, 2018): 1,187,586\n- Added throughout the year: 473,550\n- Vested during the year: 365,223\n- Forfeited during the year: 12,632\n- Non-vested at the end of the year (December 31, 2019): 1,283,281\n\nHowever, the question is asking specifically about non-vested shares vested, which is given directly in the table as 365,223.\n\nTherefore, considering the correct interpretation of the task:\n- The non-vested shares at the beginning of 2019 were 1,187,586.\n- The non-vested shares at the end of 2019 were 1,283,281.\n- The changes in non-vested shares are detailed, but the question of \"non-vested shares vested in 2019\" can be directly inferred as those shares that vested during the year and were part of the non-vested calculation, since they were vested before the year end.\n- The answer we are looking for is related to the vested shares that affected the computation of non-vested at the end of the year but specifically asking about those that vested during the year without specifying a beginning balance, we directly consider the vested amount.\n\nGiven this information, we should use the table as follows to reconcile: Starting number + changes = ending balance, and the vested amount is explicitly provided as 365,223 in the table under \"Vested.\"\nThus, the total number of non-vested shares at the start of the year that unaffected by additional vested shares is not relevant, but rather, we're focused directly on the vested shares within the provided information.\n\nHowever, to correctly state the answer without further mix-up, let's accurately reflect on the calculation for the vested amount within the context provided:\nThe question, \"What is the number of non-vested shares vested in 2019?\" refers to the portion that vested during the period, which reduces non-vested shares over this time frame from the start to the end.\n\nSince we are looking at the change caused by vesting, the table directly gives the figure of vested shares. However, if considering the overall computation:\n- Starting with 1,187,586\n- Additions: 473,550\n- Subtraction of vested: 365,223\n- Forfeited: 12,632\n- Ending balance: 1,283,281\n\nThe number of vested shares, which decreased the non-vested total from the start to the end, given directly is 365,223, this figure is the amount vested, but the context suggests considering that 365,223 shares were vested during this period without needing a computation of a cumulative balance at the start to accurately reflect on the concept of \"vested in 2019.\" The correct statement for shares vested should indeed account for the straightforward accounting of the change in non-vested shares due to the activity happening during that year, especially since the total non-vested figure at the start of the year is the point from which shares vested, and that activity in shares directly answers the question as provided.\n\nConsidering the provided data:\n1,187,586 (start non-vested) + 473,550 (added during the year) = 1,661,136 before accounting for any vested, forfeited, or adjustments not affecting the year's ending balance directly as for a straightforward non-vested calculation at the end:\n1,661,136 + 473,550 - 365,223 - 12,632 = 1,283,281 (ending balance).\n\nDirectly from the table, the number of shares vested is explicitly provided as 365,223. \n\nTherefore, to give the answer in the required format, the step of using the table directly without needing to further compute or adjust for non-vested shares as an opening balance to compute \"vested in 2019\" is accepted, based on the information explicitly provided about shares vested during the specified year.\n\nGiven this explanation and clarifying how the table directly provides the vested amount as affecting non-vested shares:\n</think>\n\n<answer> 365,223 </answer>", "pred_extracted": "365,223", "status": "equal", "method": "judge", "judge": {"decision": "equal", "confidence": 1.0, "rationale": "Exact match: both values are identical (365,223).", "raw": {"model_text": "{\n  \"decision\": \"equal\",\n  \"confidence\": 1.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"Exact match: both values are identical (365,223).\"\n}", "parsed": {"decision": "equal", "confidence": 1.0, "rationale": "Exact match: both values are identical (365,223)."}}, "error": null}}

According to the text, Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the cash-generating unit to which it relates is greater than the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use. This means that Goodwill will be considered impaired if its carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount, which is the higher of these two values. \nThe recoverable amount is determined by either fair value less costs of disposal or value in use. However, there's no specific time frame mentioned within these definitions that would directly answer the question of when Goodwill is considered impaired. Since the recoverable amount comparison can be evaluated at any point in time based on expected future cash flows, the only point of interest from the information provided is the annual review for the year-ended 31 March 2019, when, it is stated, the Directors have reviewed the value of goodwill.\nHowever, the review does not indicate that it's the only point in time when such review takes place; it could happen at any point, depending on the occurrence of impairments or change in the value. Thus, strictly speaking, the answer should reflect that Goodwill can be reviewed and considered impaired at any point when its value exceeds its recoverable amount, but the key years provided in the context are 2019 and 2018 in relation to the table given, without a specific indication of annual reviews beyond what's mentioned.\n\nGiven the structure of the provided information:\n- The key event mentioned with specific timing is \"For the year-ended 31 March 2019,\" indicating a review of the value of goodwill as of that date but does not specify if this is for impairment, only that it occurred during that year.\n- The general rule is following the handling of Goodwill as per the given rules, which typically involves estimating the recoverable amount thru either fair value less disposal costs or value in use and comparing this to the carrying amount.\n\nHence, Goodwill is likely considered impaired at any point when its carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, but the provided direct evidence for specific timing is constrained by the details given, emphasizing the review for the year-ended in 2019. However, this review in concept can technically happen at any point the Directors choose based on performance and forecasts without needing to be specifically tied to the information given in the table which provides the value of goodwill over a period but doesn't explicitly define the timing of the impairment reviews beyond specified years.\n\nTherefore, the best direct answer that follows from the specific event referenced in the provided details is that Goodwill can be considered impaired at least annually, considering the implications of changes over time or in performance that would necessitate such reviews. \n\nTo follow the exact instruction but with consideration of the text and table's dependents, there isn't enough direct explicit information in the table for answering the question about specific timing events or years outside of the annual review structures implied by the text, which typically includes assessment and treatment of losses annually in corporate accounting practices.\n\nGiven this structure, we have to choose between interpreting the most specific piece of the text that matches the question's format requirement or representing the general concept based on the annual review mentioned. The text about reviewing the value of goodwill as of a specific point doesn't explicitly mention surveillance for the sake of Goodwill allowance at that exact date (e.g., for recognizing an impairment loss immediately after identifying such a condition post-date).\n\n<answer> At least annually </answer>", "pred_extracted": "At least annually", "status": "mismatch", "method": "judge", "judge": {"decision": "not_equal", "confidence": 0.9, "rationale": "The ground truth states a specific impairment condition (carrying value greater than the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use); the prediction 'At least annually' indicates frequency of testing, not the same meaning.", "raw": {"model_text": "{\n  \"decision\": \"not_equal\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"rationale\": \"The ground truth states a specific impairment condition (carrying value greater than the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use); the prediction 'At least annually' indicates frequency of testing, not the same meaning.\"\n}", "parsed": {"decision": "not_equal", "confidence": 0.9, "rationale": "The ground truth states a specific impairment condition (carrying value greater than the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use); the prediction 'At least annually' indicates frequency of testing, not the same meaning."}}, "error": null}}

Nonetheless, we can infer that the regions listed in the table are related to the geographical areas of the company's operations since financial data for those areas is presented.\n\nHowever, to directly answer the question, the text actually doesn't provide a direct description of how goodwill was allocated but rather the process and methods used to assess impairment and how goodwill is recognized (or not recognized) as an asset on the financial statements.\n\nGiven the detailed information about impairment and its calculation, it appears the direct allocation of goodwill before impairment loss recognition isn't explicitly stated for each region.

{"idx": 391, "gt": "Earnings before taxes EBT, Income taxes", "raw_content": "(think) To determine the components considered when calculating the Profit or loss for the period from continuing operations, we need to analyze the given table and text. According to the table, the \"Profit or loss for the period from continuing operations\" is given as €359 million for 2017/2018 and €411 million for 2018/2019. However, the components can be inferred from the net financial result, which is composed of several items. The text also mentions that the \"net financial result\" comes from the addition and subtraction of several components including \"interest income/expenses (interest result)\" and \"other financial result\". Since we know the components of the net financial result and the text directly refers to these when discussing the profit/loss calculations, we can infer the calculation involves adding or subtracting these components from the net financial result to reach the \"Profit or loss for the period from continuing operations\". However, without explicit equations given for the calculation of \"Profit or loss for the period from continuing operations\" directly, we can only make an inference based on the components that are typically used in financial calculations like this.\n\nGiven the components and looking at the table provided:\n\n- The \"Profit or loss for the period from continuing operations\" equals the \"Earnings before taxes EBT\" minus the \"Profit or loss for the period from discontinued operations after taxes\" but we know that in financial terms, the direction of operations and if considering continuing operations specifically, typically, we look at the operations (income statement) without including items from discontinued operations as those would not be part of the 'continuing operations'. Hence, the essence of the profit/loss here seems to revolve around EBIT and applicable income taxes as we consider continuing operations.\n\nGiven that EBIT is primarily derived from non-operating items which directly affect EBIT and considering how profit/loss can directly come from these items without the need to compute using 'other items' directly related to 'continuing operations' specifically, and that 'Other financial result' would typically be an item considered in the full scope of financial results that might not specifically get factored directly into just 'continuing operations' without also accounting for discontinued parts, and realizing that income taxes have been provided separately for continuing operations, the approach towards calculating profit/loss specifically for continuing operations seems to focus on the direct financial performance items impacting profit/loss calculations: \n\nHowever, without explicitly calculating the components of \"Profit or loss for the period from continuing operations,\" we can only deduce that the net result includes profit before taxes from operations, less the specific accounting adjustments or costs associated directly with continuing operations.\n\nHowever, given the interest, and typical considerations in accounting principles, it's a common practice to factor in EBIT directly for profit/loss calculations without the need for separate factoring. Since other financial items, income taxes, and discontinued operation assessments might affect the full view of operations but are considered comprehensive for the company's standing, it appears the table here defaults to using EBIT as a key component, adjusted by direct distributors and other relevant items like interest and financial losses which could directly impact profit/loss without necessarily needing detailed part specifications.\n\nGiven the absence of explicit step-by-step instructions, direct usage might logically default to using the net of these operations to focus on continuing operations in practical financial report contexts.\n\nHence, logically I should express this as the computation for profit/loss from continuing operations but must reflect it as based on provided figure without giving a single equation directly due to ambiguity in instruction.

Instead, we have a table that shows various charges and expenses related to acquisitions, restructuring, and other items, which are subtracted from the operating income. The change in operating income can also be inferred from the changes in the charges listed, but for a direct answer to how much operating income changed, we actually need the dollar amounts of operating income before and after these charges. Given that, we can use the total charges and the context that the operating income decreased.\n\nFor example, if we consider the total charges for both years (the difference from 2018 to 2019), we can see an increase in total charges from $45 million in 2018 to $175 million in 2019.

The data given about sales specifically includes product and equipment sales to affiliates and purchases, but we're missing a clear breakdown of all categories in total sales for 2019 that would accurately include sales, purchases, other income, and expenses.\n\nFor clarity and the purpose of the question's focus:\n- Total sales in 2019 = $19,835 (does not directly calculate including other income and expenditures accurately without specific standalone sales data)\n- Total sales of Kyocera resale products in 2019: $18,951\n\nThe question about Kyocera resale products in the table and text specifically mentions sales by product, not directly incorporating this figure into a broader total (which might include unrelated sales not directly parallel to the question).\n\nThe percentage calculation should then consider the context that might imply what the question seeks - to see the proportion of sales directly attributed to Kyocera in the overall context of what's being discussed.\n\nThus, the correct percentage reflects sales directly mentioned in the text regarding Kyocera products by the company rather than a broader total we didn't fully account for.\n\nTo calculate the percentage:\nPercentage = (Value of Kyocera resale products / Total value of interest, which appears to be as stated total or relevant part of the sales relevant to comparison)\n= ($18,951 / $10,436)\n\nTo calculate:\n$18,951 ÷ $10,436 = 1.8897\n\nAs expressed as a percentage:\n1.8897 * 100% ≈ 188.97%\n\nThis result suggests the proportion relative to the product and equipment sold specifically to affiliates (the number that seems most directly relevant to comparing against in the spirit of product sales) which might not be the full story of the sales, purchases, and other parts of the business which could complicate how we interpret \"total sales\" absent more total figures.\n\nHowever, in adhering to the clear calculation request based on information available regarding product sales directly:\n<answer> 188.97% </answer>", "pred_extracted": "188.97%", "status": "mismatch", "method": "judge", "judge": {"decision": "not_equal", "confidence": 0.92, "rationale": "Values differ (181.59 vs 188.97) and the prediction includes a percent sign, changing the meaning; not equivalent.", "raw": {"model_text": "{\n  \"decision\": \"not_equal\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.92,\n  \"rationale\": \"Values differ (181.59 vs 188.97) and the prediction includes a percent sign, changing the meaning; not equivalent.\"\n}", "parsed": {"decision": "not_equal", "confidence": 0.92, "rationale": "Values differ (181.59 vs 188.97) and the prediction includes a percent sign, changing the meaning; not equivalent."}}, "error": null}}

We can do this by looking at the \"Sales\" section of the table provided. \n\nHowever, the total sales for AVX in 2018 is not explicitly stated, so we'll use the information given about sales of Kyocera resale products to calculate this percentage. Given:\n- Total sales of Kyocera resale products in 2018 = $296,316\n- This is a portion of the overall sales for AVX in 2018, but the total for all sales in 2018 is not directly provided.\n\nGiven this, and since the table provides a breakdown but does not directly state the total sales for all categories, the solution might involve some assumptions based on given data. Without the total sales figure for all categories in 2018, we can explore the relationship based on provided information.\n\nSince total sales data for 2018 is not given in the question, and product and equipment sales are broken down specifically but do not directly include the entire sales picture, we might infer the calculation directly depends on the \"Purchases\" and \"Dividends\" components which are explicitly provided. However, we'd need to clarify what constitutes \"total sales.\" The question about sales percentage seems to rest on understanding what is being asked: if total sales is meant to encompass all transactions (including those not specifically listed for sales), without a complete breakdown of all sales in the question, and the data regarding total sales figures is not given. Thus, we might be operating under an assumption that we have a direct tool to calculate total sales, which isn't directly stated.\n\nSince the provided data on \"Product and equipment sales\" can't be directly used without making assumptions or without more context for total sales and it is reasonable to infer we might focus on given figures or a relevant portion of them given no total for all is provided:\n- For 2017: $30,303 for product sales\n- For 2018: $26,069 for product sales to affiliates, and given there are no purchases or sales figures that explicitly cover \"all sales,\" and assuming total sales include not just the product sales but also purchases and possibly other income (like dividends), which isn't directly broken down other than to give each category over the years, we might mistakenly think of using these figures without proper calculation base (like calculating total sales, which isn't given).\n\nWithout the total sales in 2018 actually being given, but in understanding what's being asked, we'd do our best to understand the context or necessary figures:\n- Total of all sales isn't provided, just parts of it in the context of transactions with Kyocera, and the specific portion of sales data for 2018 we have from the table is $26,069. Without total sales, what could be provided in a reasonable direct calculation path requires clarification or an understanding about implicit data not provided (like total sales from other sources).\n\nThe nature of the question might imply looking at the provided table and its notes to discern parts of the total or context, even though \"total sales\" figures that could give a refine calculation base for a percentage aren't directly stated in the data or text provided, which leads to possible confusion. The total of all sales in 2018 we could attempt with the given data should encompass $26,069 plus the purchases ($256,660) and dividends ($54,810), recognizing the structure of the table starts detailing components rather than the comprehensive scale.\n\nThe calculation for the percentage involves comparing the total value of specific transactions (Kyocera resale products specific to the company's sales in 2018) against the total sales or entirety of what's categorized in 2018. Without total assessed figures for both the total sales across categories and specifically for all sales areas in 2018 given, calculating a final figure directly as requested becomes difficult, and might seem to require more parts than given for full scope.\n\nHowever, I see my main calculation method could be based on given values, which may assume or look into specifics for context around total transactions involving the sales aspect given, to derive an approximation or clarification on such a figure. Thus, for the part of sales provided for analysis:\n\nTotal Kyocera resale in 2018 = $296,316\nGiven data to consider under total sales portion aspect:\n- Product and equipment sales = $26,069\n- Purchases (which include portions not just for resale but for operational needs) = $256,660\n- Dividends paid = $54,810\n\nGiven the nature of the provided data and focusing on the context to some degree, the approach might necessitate some understanding or interpretation of the provided figures and the less complex context it allows for, which is the direct relationship including only those figures explicitly related to 2018 transactions for clarity.\n\nGiven the confusion around applicability and interpretation based on information, the most straightforward attempt still hinges on what sales categories could encompass without explicit total sales figures. Yet, for sales of a specific nature like this, without comprehensive sales totals directly given, the precise calculation path as initially outlined would typically involve knowing the total for all sales in 2018 (including not just the provided \"Product and equipment sales\" but also \"Purchases\" and \"Other\" categories which could not be precisely from the \"Sales\" section). Without the comprehensive figure, even these parts detailed become relevant for perspective.\n\nSince there might be confusion around utilizing the given figures directly without a total provided, a method could involve understanding specific parts of the 2018 transactions that are explicitly detailed and then potentially assuming or referencing those parts as relevant proportions of total sales (but recognizing the specific totals aren't given for a complete sales picture).\n\nConsider the parts detailed: \"$30,303 for product sales in 2017\" and \"$26,069 for product sales in 2018\" with no comprehensive figure given for all sales, purchases, and dividends that are not directly sales for the purpose of calculation in 2018 without clarity. Therefore, for any portion calculation based directly on data provided without more context for clarity, the total for only those listed is what could be compared directly without a total for all sales being directly provided.\n\nBut, without having a comprehensive breakdown or total for 2018 to compare directly and properly interpret into accurate figures for calculation based on given numbers directly and accurately, the final path for percentage in the context of clarifying the requested without further specification or misunderstanding would include considering how the provided parts relate to each other within the given structure.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer> There's not enough information to directly calculate the percentage of Kyocera resale products as a percentage of total sales in 2018 without either the total sales for that year or a clear definition of what constitutes this \"total sales\" figure for the companies' transactions in that year.

However, the question seems to ask for the difference between this figure and the total sales for EMD or similar, but we must clarify that the given text only explicitly discusses transactions and sales related to affiliates and does not differentiate between different categories of the company's operations directly. However, to proceed with the information given in the text regarding the sales of Kyocera's products by AVX and understanding that the table might not directly provide all categories, the most directly related figure for comparison purposes might be the sales under \"Product and equipment sales to affliates\" in 2017.\n\nGiven sales in 2017 are stated to be $30,303.

{"idx": 629, "gt": "132, 353", "raw_content": "<think>\nTo solve this question, we need to analyze the given table. The table gives information about the number of shares outstanding and the weighted average grant date fair value for nonvested shares at different dates. Specifically, we are interested in the number of nonvested shares granted between certain dates.\n\nFirst, we look at the table for the row \"Granted\" that is associated with the years we are interested in. \n- For the period ending January 1, 2018, the granted shares are 132 (thousands).\n- Between December 30, 2018, and December 29, 2019, the granted shares are 110 (thousands, but since the question seems to ask for shares between these two dates, it seems we should consider shares granted up to the end of 2019 Plan which is January 1, 2020 - December 31, 2020 but the specific year question points back to 2019).\n\nGiven that, we are to identify shares granted between these periods as per the data available which ends in the year indicated by December 29. Thus, the number of shares granted to nonvested shares as per the logic given from the granted sections (and correcting based on the data point required in the question, \"Granted\" for the \"Nonvested at January 1, 2018\" period is relevant as it refers to shares added in the year prior), we get granted shares as follows: For the correct counting method given our requested time frame, we look at grants between specified dates (which actually might refer to total number of shares granted for each year, given how our table actually breaks down and restates to show activity over time).\n\nFor January 1, 2017 to end of 2017: 132 (thousands) shares granted  \nFor December 30, 2018 to December 29, 2019: 110 (thousands) shares granted\n\nGiven the way the question is phrased, to find the correct answer, we interpret it as looking at shares granted during each time frame, but the exact interpretation might require further adjustment based on how shares counts are considered in the accounting context provided. Given the data format provided and typical accounting treatments for periods, focusing solely on granted shares as described narrows our approach but provides clarity.\n\nNow looking specifically at what we know:\n\n- January 1, 2017 to January 1, 2018 had grants of 132 (thousands).\n- December 30, 2018, to December 29, 2019, had grants of 110 (thousands).\n\nNow summing up the information provided which is directly about the years ending at those dates we're checking:\nTotal = (grants before the end of 2017 period + grants between December 2018 to December 2019).\n\nGiven the total nonvested outstanding at those periods include both prior grants and those listed for each period:\n\nShares granted at the beginning period + shares granted in the later period:\nTherefore we compute the equation specifically focusing on what's directly mentioned for granted shares (and how they impact what is counted and what's shown over time for each period).\n\nThe relevant sums (considering just the direct granted shares which correspond to our specified periods as examples):\n\nFor each year or part of a year:\n- January 1, 2017 to January 1, 2018 (or the period surrounding the year, we are using a start and end point as examples):\n  <think>\n  to the previous year end for calculation purposes, consider as:\n  <answer> 132 (thousands) </answer>\n- December 30, 2018 to December 29, 2019:\n  <answer> 110 (thousands) </answer>\n\nHence, manually, the equation:\nAnnual comparison:\n- (Beginning of a period, here the granted before the year in question) + (Granted shares over the year, ending at the period in question) aren't directly summable in simplified terms, given the entire context is to describe the number of shares, hence the appropriate numbers to use are either directly from those time frames or reflective of the cumulative nature but correctly interpreted from the data, focusing on \"Granted\" for specific periods and overall impacts on the total nonvestment at the start and end points of the given time frame (as data summary of RSU activity).\n</think>\n\n<think>\nTo sum it up correctly based on given data (keeping in mind the requirement to be clear and the table's structure):\n\nGiven the question asks about number of nonvested shares granted, which for accounting might not necessarily add in simple arithmetic but looks at changes in the account for each year-end.\n\nThus to address the task in a straightforward manner:\nShares = year-end prior + year-end current\nBut here correctly interpreting the data as per the year-end requirement isn't as simple as just adding the given \"Granted\" amounts as it requires looking at the impact of starts and ends of periods and accounting treatments.\n\nThe calculation to express shares granted over the year based on the table structure could be based on the total change over time but for direct numbers as requested seems to specifically use the \"Granted\" row for the period before the end of the year listed (for that year-end change).\n\nThe hopes here is clarity rather than calculation simplicity, but the direct interpretation might seem to point to one approach or another based on how stocks are accounted for over time and specific accounting treatments at the year-end.\n\nThe exact straightforward calculation could imply:\nShares granted before a year-end point = Total nonvested at the year start + Shares granted during that year up until the year-end (but accounting might use prior years' counts in a cumulative sense not requiring such direct additions).\n\nFor the shares granted over the two periods we directly see from the granted row, without complex calculation:\nYear 2017 to 2018 change and Year 2018 to 2019 change shares are what grants changed the numbers for nonvested at the respective year-ends.\n\nHence thinking through but applying directly for a clear answer, we will directly report the shares granted during those specified periods without the confusion:\n</think>\n\nTherefore based on our thinking about the shares granted:\n- Shares granted between January 1, 2017 and the end of that period (considering the given structure for RSUs grants we prepare the answer focusing on the departmental time frames given):\n- Number of shares granted from January 1, 2017, up to end of 2017: Not the topic but a reference point.\n- Number of shares granted between December 30, 2018 and December 29, 2019: Our reference point as per the data.\n\n<think>\nThus summarizing what directly addresses the question and relates to the accounting treatment for year-end shares:\n- Beginning shares (January 1, 2017 to January 1, 2018) if we were to consider direct change before year-end:\n  <answer> 132 (thousands) </answer>\n- Ending shares (December 30, 2018 to December 29, 2019), considering the activity around the year-end:\n  <answer> 110 (thousands) </answer>\n\nThis would be a straightforward approach if considering shares granted between these points as per RSUs/PRSUs activity, focusing on directly reported granted amounts as they relate to yearly changes:\nEnd of year grant changes: For each year given.\n- Beginning of that year and shares at the start of the time frame are candidates for interpretation.\n\nSince we want a straightforward interpretation focusing on the information given, the calculation would simply look at the granted shares between those years:\nWe have granted shares right before the year end (as reported under \"Granted\" for each period) and the total after for that year-end:\nGiven we need the shares for granted over those periods and not a cumulative total up until the specific year-end, we directly report what we understand about grants:\n\n<think> Given the task, to clearly frame this answer and directly address the type of information requested, we correct our focus to answering as directly as possible with the data given without taking into account specific year-end versus the preceding year-end change magnitudes in accounting but rather what directly affects the counts for the nonvested shares at year-end:\nGiven the table's structure, the number of shares granted in each \"period\" directly section is what we would the number of shares that vested or were granted during those periods is reflective of activity but strictly looking at \"Granted\" as per the data might be interpreted as only those shares for the respective years given without considering cumulative totals at the start or end of those year periods in the table's total. </think>\n\nGiven the emphasis on clarity for answering directly, without delving into comprehensive accounting that includes total nonvested at all periods, and following the format for answering requested, \n<think> The focus on numbers (in thousands) granted directly in the period without comprehensive review is thus:\n1,132,000 (shares represented for grants between the end of 2018 and 29, 2019) for shares granted: For calculations based directly on the \"Granted\" line of the table and clarifying our approach to follow the requested information and to avoid complexity:\n\n</think>\nTo finalize and provide clarity on the requested information without overstating the interpretation:\nAnnual grants:\nFor each year the \"Granted\" number directly before the year's end:\nDirect calculation of shares from grants would use granted numbers directly for each period.\n\nWe can sum the shares (considering only what we were told directly for granted shares and focusing on clarity):\nNo total shares at the beginning of 2017 and ending of 2017 or how they change is needed but \"Granted\" shows activity over those periods, focusing on provided data.\n\nHence, the interpretation should reflect the specific question but following the logic of shares accounting and directly answering:\n\nWe focus strictly on:\n<think> Given the format, we interpret the question as directly asking for the given data without extensive calculation but clarity.\n\nTo conclude, \n<answer> For January 1, 2017 to January 1, 2018 grants: 132 (thousands) shares.

The specific numbers of shares granted at these times would involve looking at the \"Granted\" rows in the table for the respective years, noting that the January 1, 2017, figure is represented by shares that were nonvested and therefore did not need to be granted during 2017. The shares granted later in 2017 are what would affect the January 1, 2018, balance, thus continuing our calculation which should properly account for all changes due to the question.\n\nWe know that:\n- 98 thousand shares were nonvested at January 1, 2017.\n- Then, between January 1, 2018, and December 30, 2018, 110 thousand shares were granted.\n- Between January 1, 2019, and December 29, 2019, 353 thousand shares were granted.\n\nHowever, this problem asks for the average granted shares between these times, which we identify by the changes in nonvested shares over the periods. To calculate the average granted during these periods directly from the table provided without properly considering the year-end balances for each year as indicated directly in the \"Granted\" amounts may not be entirely accurate since we are asked for the \"average number of nonvested shares granted\" but this figure can be misleading as we are dealing with grant specifics rather than overall nonvested balance changes.\n\nSo the average of the granted shares over these periods directly taken from the table is calculated as the total granted shares divided by the number of periods:\n(Granted in 2018 + Granted in 2019) / 2 = (132 + 353) / 2\nHowever, this method doesn't account for the shares that were granted in 2017 that affected the 2018 balance, hence for an updated understanding of \"average granted\" without the confusion of the method used:\nAverage = Total nonvested at start of the range (rescaled for reference periods) since shares granted in the first year need to be factored into the calculation for understanding the dynamics involved in change analysis between these critical dates.\n\nTherefore, for calculation accuracy based on grant numbers per year that reflect periods around the original question of accounting method precision:\nTotal granted in period = 110,000 + 353,000\nNumber of periods = 2\nAverage shares granted = Total / Number of periods but correctly understood to reflect the actual grant activity by translating the start balance to match the accounting method being queried for understanding the dynamics in accounting for the changes during these years.\n</think>\n\n<think>\nTo clarify, the actual calculation involves understanding the table to the extent that shares were granted over the [start date 2017 (as implied full year effect on share count in 2018)] [start date 2018] [start date 2019], with the specific grant and vesting schedule considered for the full year.\nHence the calculation method inaccurately described; it should consider all shares moved in and the function being asked should more directly pertain to grants per year separately rather than as a single average number of shares per year.\nAverage annual granted should, therefore, consider not just shares granted between the end dates of the years 2018, 2019 but also reflect the adjustments and changes that took place before those points and be compensated for the impact of shares granted in prior years which have a footprint on the year-end balances for calculations over the periods.\n</think>\n\n<answer> 167 thousand </answer>", "pred_extracted": "167 thousand", "status": "mismatch", "method": "judge", "judge": {"decision": "not_equal", "confidence": 0.95, "rationale": "Ground truth is 242.5 while prediction is 167,000 (167 thousand); these values differ drastically and are not equivalent.", "raw": {"model_text": "{\"decision\":\"not_equal\",\"confidence\":0.95,\"rationale\":\"Ground truth is 242.5 while prediction is 167,000 (167 thousand); these values differ drastically and are not equivalent.\"}", "parsed": {"decision": "not_equal", "confidence": 0.95, "rationale": "Ground truth is 242.5 while prediction is 167,000 (167 thousand); these values differ drastically and are not equivalent."}}, "error": null}}

First, we need to identify the number of shares vested on January 1, 2017. According to the table, the number of shares nonvested at January 1, 2017, is 98,000, and the number of shares vested up to January 1, 2018, is 43. This is calculated as the reduction in nonvested shares during 2017. \n2. Next, we find the number of shares vested between December 30, 2018, and December 29, 2019. Looking at the table, the number of shares vested between December 30, 2018, and December 29, 2019, can be found by comparing the nonvested shares at the end of 2018 and the end of 2019. The nonvested shares at December 30, 2018, are 183,000, and the number vested from December 30, 2018, to December 29, 2019, is calculated by subtracting the nonvested shares at December 29, 2019, from the nonvested shares at December 30, 2018. The number of vested shares from 2018 to 2019 = 183,000 - 377,000 = -194,000. However, the calculation implies that we're looking for shares vested from December 30, 2018, to December 29, 2019, so the actual vested during this period should be altered based on nonvested at the end of each period considering the grant and vesting that occur, especially how the nonvested balance reflects changes (grants, vesting, and forfeitures). Based on the provided table, we actually calculate it by the change in nonvested positions:\n- Starting nonvested at January 1, 2018: 168,000\n- Ending nonvested at December 30, 2018: 183,000\n- Starting nonvested at January 1, 2019: 363,000 (as per the provided numbers after considering the January 1, 2018, to December 30, 2018, period)\n- Ending nonvested at December 29, 2019: 377,000\nThe initial numbers equate to 43 (Net Change from January 1, 2017, to January 1, 2018), and 117 (net change from December 30, 2018, to December 29, 2019) shares vested, respectively, during the initial nonvested reduction, then subsequently, between December and the ends of the year.\n\nTherefore, considering the change and thus looking at these share movements (granding and vesting), the calculation seems to involve identifying movements rather than the change itself directly without considering shares granted.\n\nTo correct this approach:\n- (43) shares vested in 2017.\n- (117) shares between 2018 and 2019, which is calculated based on the nonvested shares at the end of each period without the direct consideration of granted and vested in the same period share calculation.\n\nConsidering a calculation mistake in step-by-step explanation without separate mention of explicit calculation on shares granted/ vested, the problem essentially is asking for how many shared were vested in each period without considering the progression through time including share grants.\n\nGiven the actual way calculations work, it seems the understanding of the grant date and vesting schedule impacts share balance in a non-straightforward manner without linear progression based solely on granted/vested amounts.\n\nHowever, if considering a straightforward average number of nonvested shares vested:\n- At January 1, 2017: 98,000 shares vested\n- Between December 30, 2018, to December 29, 2019: 117 shares vested\n\nThis understanding however seems mistaken as a misinterpretation of share vesting and grant behaviors according to the actual data given.\n\nThus, sticking to straightforward calculations based on provided data without considering the implications of the calendar dates and considering \"average\" might imply a misunderstanding without explicit total vested durations:\nAverage number of shares vested = ((98 + 117)/2) is not correct as it implies an error in interpreting the question, which asks for shares vested at two points in time rather than an entirety.\n</think>\n\n<think> Correct Solution: \nGiven the confusion in explaining, the task may be interpreted as taking an average of shares vested over the specified periods rather than calculating shares vested in those periods.\n- At the start: 98,000 shares vested\n- Between the end of 2018 and 2019: let's redo the calculation correctly:  To find the average number of shares vested, first understand the question might imply calculating the shares that are vested over these periods, not the number vested in each respective year but the average over time:\nThe formula to calculate average is: Average = (Sum of all values) / (Number of values)\nFirst, we find the total shares vested during these periods: Total vested shares = 43,000 (in 2017) + 117 (between 2018 and 2019) is incorrect for the total vested in this timeframe because the question appears asking about an average number of nonvested shares at two points rather than calculating total vested in each year or considering cumulative shares, but for the intention of calculating vested over time: Total shares vested = 43 (2017) + 77 (2018-2019).\nTo calculate: Average vested shares = (43 (2017 vested) + 77 (2018-2019 vested)) / (Number of periods over which these are calculated)\nSince the \"average\" likely refers to shares vested in those periods:\nTotal vested shares = 120\nNumber of share periods = 2\n</think>\n<think> \nAverage calculation: Average = Total vested shares / Number of periods\n= (43 + 77) / 2 = 120 / 2 = 60\n</think>\n\n<answer> 60 </answer>", "pred_extracted": "60", "status": "mismatch", "method": "judge", "judge": {"decision": "not_equal", "confidence": 0.95, "rationale": "Numeric values differ: ground truth is 80.5 while prediction is 60 (absolute difference 20.5), so they are not equivalent.", "raw": {"model_text": "{\n  \"decision\": \"not_equal\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.95,\n  \"rationale\": \"Numeric values differ: ground truth is 80.5 while prediction is 60 (absolute difference 20.5), so they are not equivalent.\"\n}", "parsed": {"decision": "not_equal", "confidence": 0.95, "rationale": "Numeric values differ: ground truth is 80.5 while prediction is 60 (absolute difference 20.5), so they are not equivalent."}}, "error": null}}

According to the text, Food Care assets were understated by $372.9 million. However, this amount had an offset to Product Care of $369.6 million and $3.3 million to assets not allocated. This means the $372.9 million was part of the total adjustment made to correct the error. To get the original, unrevised value for Food Care for 2018 before any of these adjustments, we can apply the given offset and correction directly to the revised value for Food Care for 2018.\n\nThe revised value for Food Care in 2018 is $1,914.4 million. The adjustment to correct the error resulted in an increase to Food Care of $372.9 million. However, this $372.9 million includes the net effect of adjusting Food Care, Product Care, and assets not allocated, with adjustments of $369.6 million going to Product Care and $3.3 million going to assets not allocated. \n\nSince we are looking to find the \"unrevised\" value of Food Care for 2018 before any corrections, we can consider that the entire $372.9 million was an adjustment to the allocation between segments. Thus, without the correction, the Food Care figure would be lower. However, the exact reduction needed for an accurate \"unrevised\" value isn't directly provided. But given we are looking at how much was added (and thus the amount to subtract to find a theoretical \"if no correction\" position) - the value given that was adjusted is $372.9 million, not accounting for rebalances. The adjustment given directly involves offsets to and from Food Care in the allocation, making the $372.9 million an incomplete figure for what was actually changed for Food Care without specifying the adjustment. This requires correctly putting back the $372.9 million in \"correction\" amount that moves to Food Care in the original amounts without overcounting or assuming further adjustments than are known.\n\nThe equation provided in words should consider moving the $372.9 million and its impact back into an original Good Care calculation for 2018, without the total offset, but to directly identify an \"unrevised\" value in terms of calculation from provided data isn't directly frameable without total correction amounts that involve both Food Care and another segment. However, the simple adjustment of adding back $372.9 million as an example to address the \"unrevised\" figure seems the wrong approach as the given values should relate directly to what was initially allocated before the adjustment minus only the immediate offset provided (which actually is an increase, not a subtraction, since that adjustment impacted Food Care and others directly for correction purposes). Without additional context on the exact un-adjusted allocations before the \"revised\" amounts were published (and correcting those), this leaves a logical and methodological path to a theoretical figure without direct, necessary data.\n\nHowever, to calculate an adjusted figure and follow doctrine that to reverse an adjustment (and given only adjustments to the segments without further detail on the change in uncorrected values for segments directly before those corrections) implies a direct adjustment of the Food Care segment by reversing what was added directly, even with the given correction. A mathematical direct calculation isn't provided because the exact initial values before adjustment aren't explicitly stated other than '$1,914.4 million for Food Care in 2018.\n\nThus, considering method step: steps described texts imply an operation to reverse the adjustment or utilize the provided figures for interpreting segments post-correcture values rather than pre-correcture.\n\n</think>\n<answer> $1,914.4 million + $372.9 million (as a part of the adjustment not extracted specifically for Food Care) </answer> is theoretically incorrect without context on original values. The critical interpretation here involves understanding we are working with a figure provided (revised) that was adjusted and need to interpret or use that adjustment in our calculations without detailed information on what those adjustments imply on a pre-revised (or exact pre-adjustment) basis for other segments or overall totals of amounts not allocated directly to segments before correction for an accurate pre-revised Number. However, given the task to directly use the provided \"revised\" food care value for 2018 in an equation isn't directly calculable based on the text's provided details of adjustments without further segment details.\n\nHowever, if interpreting in simple adjustment terms and given that my specific method may not apply since the correction wasn't the primary amount affecting Food Care in isolation, but if forced into a 'simple math' equation based on correction:\n<think> The request seems misleading without specific starting values for Food Care or proper interpretation of adjustment impacts on other segments. But a simplistic interpretation of needing an \"unrevised\" figure isn't calculable directly from the given correction and should consider original 'positions' before those corrections were applied and only the stated corrections.</think> Given the text and table and that no simple formula applies directly without more detailed adjustments or starting values for other segments and without directly stated reversals that could apply directly to Food Care, we identify an error in direct calculation:\n<answer> The data provided in the question and our response process have resulted in an error.

However, the servicing related allowance for losses is not a direct subtraction, as it doesn't specify if it's a part of the general transaction related allowance or separate, which could make our calculation complex without clear definitions provided. Instead, we should notice the total allowance directly provided in the table for losses, $(238) for 2019 and $(168) for 2018.\n\nWe can proceed with calculating the percentage change based on the information directly given in the table for the total allowance for losses.\nFor 2018, the total allowance for losses is $168 thousand, and for 2019, it's $238 thousand.\n\nTo find the percentage change: \n\\[Percentage Change = \\left( \\frac{New Value - Old Value}{Old Value} \\right) \\times 100\\]\n\nGiven that we're working with the provided figures without additional context:\n\\[New Value = 238, Old Value = 168\\]\n\n\\[Percentage Change = \\left( \\frac{238}{168} \\right) \\times 100\\]\n\nCalculating the exact change based on given data: \n\\[= (1.42857) \\times 100\\]\n\nTherefore, rounded out for percentage change:\n\\[= 142.857 \\%\n\n</think>\n<answer> 142.857% </answer>", "pred_extracted": "142.857%", "status": "mismatch", "method": "judge", "judge": {"decision": "not_equal", "confidence": 0.92, "rationale": "The values differ: ground truth is 41.67 (≈41.67), prediction is 142.857% (≈142.857), which are not the same; percent notation does not reconcile the difference.", "raw": {"model_text": "{\"decision\":\"not_equal\",\"confidence\":0.92,\"rationale\":\"The values differ: ground truth is 41.67 (≈41.67), prediction is 142.857% (≈142.857), which are not the same; percent notation does not reconcile the difference.\"}", "parsed": {"decision": "not_equal", "confidence": 0.92, "rationale": "The values differ: ground truth is 41.67 (≈41.67), prediction is 142.857% (≈142.857), which are not the same; percent notation does not reconcile the difference."}}, "error": null}}

This means that this amount is recognized as part of the total stock-based compensation expense for 2019. Additionally, $60.3 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense as of December 31, 2019, will be amortized over the years, but the text specifically mentions how this will be amortized and the total compensation expense recognized and unrecognized for 2019.

Therefore, we must deduce that the question essentially seeks the net total which would account for how much was recognized and how much was amortized for each category but isn't explicitly provided for all categories separately for 2019 in terms of distinct amounts without further calculation or the calculation isn't provided in the given information for the year 2019.

Therefore, the best approach considering the strict format and data given would involve understanding the nature of stock-based compensation expense and its accounting treatment, which typically involves considering all expenses recognized and how they're amortized, but the specific details of how these expenses are broken down for the year 2019 in the question are not directly answerable from the text without further information or calculation beyond the provided table data.\n\nThe closest interpretation based on the data given would be considering the total as per the table for 2019 without overcomplicating, but that approach still doesn't align directly with the request for a recognition of both the provided numbers for the expense categories and a calculation of an aggregate total for 2019.\n\nHowever, focusing strictly on what's given and what one could derive from the table and text about 2019 specifically:\n\n- Sales and marketing expense, 2019: $6,812\n- Research and development expense, 2019: $4,804\n- General and administrative expense, 2019: $18,328\n- Cost of revenues, 2019: $2,193\n- Total stock-based compensation expense, 2019, as directly given: $32,137\n\nGiven the table data, one could interpret the query as asking for the sum of these 2019 expenses if the implication is to sum these, but this still doesn't directly answer the query based on the details about recognized and unrecognized expenses without more context of how they're treated or classified in 2019 for a more accurate extract.\n\nGiven the strict answer format requirement and the confusion about interpretation:\n\nThe information about the total for 2019 in the table is directly taken for clarity on what expenses were for that year but does not adjust or break down those totals into separate accounts of recognized versus unrecognized separately for each category in 2019.\n\nTherefore, the calculation or reference for the answer given the format implies a consideration of what is directly provided and most straightforward, given the expense categories and their values, even though this isn't the direct sum or breakdown the question might have been pointing towards.\n\n</think>\n\nHowever, adhering strictly to the format:\n\nThe question might imply looking directly at the data provided without a detailed breakdown beyond the line totals or additional nuance on amortization provided in the text:\n\nThe answer to the question as directly supported from the data provided without a combined direct total provided beyond the given line items and considering the typical approach to such queries:\nGiven that we're supposed to answer based on the information within the text and table and following the structured format of the question which might not require complex calculations but implying what is provided for 2019:\n\n\n<answer> $32,137 </answer>", "pred_extracted": "The question format does not provide a sufficient basis for extracting the exact figure for the year 2019 from the provided text, but it can be inferred that the stock-based compensation expense for 2019 is part of the expenses detailed in the table for that year.

Operating Profit + Depreciation and Amortization = £264.9m + £32.9m\n\nLet's perform these calculations to understand the process:\n- For 2019: £282.7m + £34.3m = £317.0m\n- For 2018: £264.9m + £32.9m = £297.8m\n\nTherefore, the formula to calculate EBITDA is: EBITDA = Adjusted Operating Profit + Depreciation and Amortization of Property, Plant, and Equipment, Software, and Development\n\nGiven the exact numbers, the formula translates into: \n- For 2019: EBITDA = £282.7m + £34.3m\n- For 2018: EBITDA = £264.9m + £32.9m\n\nIn a general formula form (since we don't always have the exact numbers in our head):\n- EBITDA = Adjusted Operating Profit + Depreciation and Amortization\n\nSince the calculations above directly lead to the given formulas in the text, we conclude the process is described in the provided text, validating our initial interpretation.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer> EBITDA = Adjusted Operating Profit + Depreciation and Amortization </answer>", "pred_extracted": "EBITDA = Adjusted Operating Profit + Depreciation and Amortization", "status": "equal", "method": "judge", "judge": {"decision": "equal", "confidence": 0.9, "rationale": "Both statements define EBITDA as adjusted operating profit plus depreciation and amortisation; the ground-truth's itemization of asset types (PPE, software, development) does not change the formula, so the prediction is equivalent.", "raw": {"model_text": "{\"decision\":\"equal\",\"confidence\":0.9,\"rationale\":\"Both statements define EBITDA as adjusted operating profit plus depreciation and amortisation; the ground-truth's itemization of asset types (PPE, software, development) does not change the formula, so the prediction is equivalent.\"}", "parsed": {"decision": "equal", "confidence": 0.9, "rationale": "Both statements define EBITDA as adjusted operating profit plus depreciation and amortisation; the ground-truth's itemization of asset types (PPE, software, development) does not change the formula, so the prediction is equivalent."}}, "error": null}}

Since 2017 provides an expense where there's a positive entry and 2018 a negative expense and 2019 is given:\n$26 (2017) as expense\n$-13 (2018) as benefit \n$3 (2019) as expense\n\nNow, to find the total federal tax expense between 2017 to 2019 requires adding the expenses together. However, since we only include data for 2018 and 2019 from the federal tax perspective for addition and 2017 expense being a separate year, we'll be adding the given federal tax expense/benefit numbers for 2018 and 2019, ignoring the 2017 federal tax expense as per the table as that is the period of reporting.\n\nTotal federal tax expense between 2017 to 2019:\n$90 for 2018 (Federal tax expense in thousands) and $3 in 2019.\nThe calculation for the federal tax expense between 2017 to 2019 requires understanding we're calculating the exposure based on the given data. Therefore, only items directly provided for calculation should be considered.\nGiven 2017 has $26 federal tax expense and 2018 has $-13 federal tax benefit (which we factor in with its expense in 2018 calculation):\n$3 expense in 2019 and $-13 (benefit in 2018 that we count as expense for calculation for period of these three years but remember considering its practical presentation is as a deduction).\n\nWe add all federal tax expenses and this confirms the real amount over the period shown that we can accurately add this from 2017's start considering it's actually asking for calculation from 2017 up, hence:\n$26 expense in 2017, ($-13) (we will add $13 to account for expense, if this is thought as expense benefit and possible confusion it seems in instructions).\n</think>\n\n<think>\nTotal federal tax expense = $26 (2017) + $-13 (benefit, but considered as reduction of expense so increase it by adding to expenses: considering calculation value: it's actually taken from total as expense and then added for that year for total expense which seems a bit confusing based on written instructions so clarification needed): $3 expense for 2019 is clear expense, $-13 benefit in 2018 considered here for expenses = $26 expense in 2017 + ($13 expense not benefit) + $3 expense in 2019 \nTherefore, confusion in instruction to calculate it.\nThus, simpler calculation to follow the thought process given directly in instructions (likely without explicit mention that we're actually using it as a net addition to federal expense over period): $26 expense for 2017; $-13 reduces total federal, made into $26 (expense over 2017 value but counting into 2017's calculation for start year correct) and then the given 2019 expense. $26 + (-13) + 3 = ?\n\nFor clarity on real instructions to calculate the total for this period:\nTotal for the period for federal = $26 (for 2017) + $-13 (Actually is a reduction so in our addition: use the expense number directly, ignoring this could cause confusion without correcting that instruction) and $3.\nGiven confusion, let's directly add:\n$26 (Expense for 2017) + (Increase for $13 which we keep for direct calculation to get total of just federal in three years) + $3 expense in 2019 = $90 total expense added for federal over 3 years in the given report.\n</think>\n\n<think>\nTo solve the confusion, as all direct numbers are considered (despite starting in the middle and ending without adding outside values for given years explicitly without text giving a specific way around this) and summing $26 + $-13 and $3 as directly provided:\nSo the addition that needs to be accurate includes the start and end points and middle in a way that follows the question as directly asking for between 2017 and 2019's total federal tax expense addition. For clarity, let's say, $26 is truly an expense in 2017 which is $26 for 2017 federal tax, and $-13 is a reduction as federal tax benefit, thus to follow the direct query and text aimed for understanding:\nJust calculating: \n$26 ( expense for 2017) + $(-13) reduction in federal tax expense in 2018 which actually represents as $13 increase in expense (hence we help clarify here using calculation, even though $-13 seems like an expense in the table explanation at first, its benefit makes it a reduction for that year and calculation reflects actual accounting practice to reduce that expense by a certain amount each year as explained before).\n</think>\n\n<think>\n$3 (expense for 2019) for the federal tax. Therefore:\nAdding all, we clarify the process here without previous miscalculation and focus on given data that it represents: $26 (start of period) + $-13 (middle of period) + $3 (end of period) = $90 for the federal tax over the 3 years period considering how it's considered. Without equation error:\n$26 (2017 expense), $-13 as an addition (denoted in reduction since we add expenses for the federal tax calculation period from 2017 to 2019) added with $3 (2019 expense): \nWe know this, to solve confusion.\n</think>\n\n<think>\nAnswer begins.\nGiven total, the confusion previously was how the calculation would proceed to identify total federal tax expense over the three-year period. In calculation, the numbers provided should guide us to directly sum the federal tax expenses without considering total changes from one period to another without explicit directions for each period's start and end (especially with year given).\nIn the calculation described ( critically considering the problem to directly solve with information given for federal tax in years 2017, 2018, and 2019), \nTherefore, starting from 2017 until 2019, to answer as per total given without considering starts and end direction from year-to-year explicitly, \nTo solve the confusion (despite this detailed calculation) the direct answer would need more simple calculation without the analysis but this explanation gives context. Final equation as per given:\nTotal federal from 2017 to 2019 = $26 (expense, 2017) + $3 (expense, 2019) + (-$13, benefit, 2018) \nThis shows the reconsideration: without benefit confusion but adding all federal amounts given as expense or reduction over the period of three years (which were the totals and periods asked from 2017 to 2019). \n</think>\n\n<answer> $90 </answer>", "pred_extracted": "$90", "status": "mismatch", "method": "judge", "judge": {"decision": "not_equal", "confidence": 0.98, "rationale": "Ground truth is the number 16, while the prediction is $90 — different numeric value and currency, so they are not equivalent.", "raw": {"model_text": "{\n  \"decision\": \"not_equal\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.98,\n  \"rationale\": \"Ground truth is the number 16, while the prediction is $90 — different numeric value and currency, so they are not equivalent.\"\n}", "parsed": {"decision": "not_equal", "confidence": 0.98, "rationale": "Ground truth is the number 16, while the prediction is $90 — different numeric value and currency, so they are not equivalent."}}, "error": null}}

{"idx": 864, "gt": "net revenue for fiscal 2019 increased $47 million, and our operating expenses decreased $12 million", "raw_content": "<think>\nTo determine the result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance, we should look at the information provided in the text. The text mentions that the adoption of the new guidance resulted in an increase in net revenue of $47 million and a decrease in operating expenses of $12 million. However, the question asks for the result of the adoption, which could be interpreted as either the change in revenue, the change in expenses, or the overall impact on the company's financial statements. Since the question does not specify, we'll consider both scenarios. \nThe table provides the financial data \"As Reported\" and \"Without Adoption of New Standard\" for several items, which can be used to see the impact of the adoption on various line items. However, the overall effect on the company's financial statements, such as the increase in net revenue and decrease in operating expenses, is directly provided in the text.\nSo, focusing on the financial impact on the balance sheet and cash flow, we find that the adoption increased total assets by $114 million and decreased total liabilities by $128 million (which reflects the change in net revenues and expense recognition which would affect these items), and it also had an immediate effect on several line items within the financial statements, such as accounts receivable, other current assets, and liabilities.\nGiven this complex scenario and to answer the question directly based on the table and provided text, we see the most direct answer to the result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance would relate to the changes it directly impacts the most. However, the impact of the revenue recognition on the overall financials including increased revenue is key to understanding company performance.\n\nThe most accurate interpretation seems to rely on the financial metrics directly influenced by the new guidance, rather than a basic numerical outcome. For example, an increase of $114 million in total assets and $50 million in accrued revenues may indicate why net revenue went up by $47 million when the expenses (operating expenses decreased $12 million) wouldn't be directly stated in those terms from the text, but rather these represent changes.\nThe direct financial changes from the text lead to understanding the guidance's impact: The balance of assets and liabilities increased due to how revenues and expenses are reported under the new standard.\nThe key figure that we need to note, however, is: the increase in net revenue and the company's asset base due to how certain revenues and expenses are recognized now affects the overall balance of the financials. \n\nBut, what can we directly say about the result of the adoption?\nLet's recall: Adoption of the new guidance led to an increase in total revenue and a decrease in operating expenses and the balance sheet reflects changes due to how revenue and expenses are now recognized. So the figure to focus on is simply stating the financial impact without misinterpretation.\n\nGiven the question asks for the result of adoption without specific detail for every aspect but rather seems to seek a broad interpretation.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer> The adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance increased net revenue and decreased operating expenses. </answer> \nHowever, for a precise impact considering all provided details including the text which speaks of both asset and liability adjustments and the effects noticed, we must conclude that without specific data to link this to, the key takeaway here involves recognizing an increase in net revenues recognized ($47 million) alongside adjustments to the balance sheet such as increased total assets ($114 million) and liabilities ($128 million decrease), all stemming from how revenues and certain costs are now recognized and accounted for. But for the direct numerical answer to what the adoption 'resulted in,' considering typical question expectations, one might lean towards mentioning the net changes observed across the financial statements influenced by this policy change. The exact calculation to represent the direct numerical impact on overall company performance isn't detailed to be computed in a straightforward numerical equation but involves understanding revenue, asset, and liability adjustments shown in the financial table. Thus, summarizing the direct impact from the few explicitly stated changes: \n\nThe adoption impacts both revenue recognition and expense recognition, thus:\n- $47 million increase in net revenue and\n- $12 million decrease in operating expenses (though not directly from the provided equation), among others like changes in accounts receivable, other current and long-term assets, and liabilities, all reflecting how revenues and expenses are now accounted for under the new guidance.

However, to calculate the percentage of shares purchased in this first month relative to the total in the three-month period, we must consider shares bought prior as well.\n\nGiven:\n- Total shares purchased in the three months = 7,250 (in thousands)\n- Total shares purchased (indicating the entire period considered) = 7,250 thousand shares\n- Shares purchased in the first month after the large increase started (March 23, 2019 - April 26, 2019) = 3,608 thousand shares\n\nHowever, the total for the entire temporary \"first month\" mentioned is only 3,608 thousand shares, we also need to consider the period before that or the beginning of this period to understand the entire period's share calculation but since the data is given per three-month segments, we'll focus on the given totals which are the totals for the respective three-month periods for calculating percentages directly.\n\nThe correct \"first month\" in the data for significant purchase is 'January 26, 2019 - February 22, 2019' with 262 thousand shares, as it marks the renewal of the significant purchase period mentioned in the March period and reflects a comparison basis within the given data structure.\n\nGiven we have misunderstood in terms of defining the \"first month\" in the data considering share quantity significantly reduced each consecutive month, it makes more sense to consider the first full month where purchases fell back, reflecting a conclusion based on the April 26th end of period rather than trying to reach back through time from a later observation.\n\nSo, we are actually focusing on 'Total shares purchased in January' as a proxy for this step in assessing its impact.

We are only interested in the \"Land and\" column because it specifically mentions \"Leases\" and \"Leases\".

We are asked for the total accumulated amortization for June 30, 2017.\n\nGiven that the accumulated amortization is the sum of amortizations over the years for which it applies, we can directly sum the stated amounts without needing further breakdowns from the table provided.\n\nFor June 30, 2017, the total accumulated amortization would then be the sum of the amortizations added up to that point, but here, we see the specifics of what was amortized for each year.\n\nHowever, looking closer at the task, it seems we are actually looking for the total accumulated amortization that would be expected as of June 30, 2017, given the table doesn't directly give us the detailed accumulated amounts for each asset that were accumulated up to June 30, 2017.\n\nWe can infer this total, however, given the crucial information about the net and gross values but without direct background data like the specific line items (e.g., individual asset values and their respective accumulated amortization applied by the end of June 30, 2017).\n\nUnderstanding the steps to get the direct info: Given the direct information provided, it seems we need specific guidance or further breakdowns (not given), or to make an assumption that we should consider.\n\nSince I am only considering what's provided in the text:\n- 2019: $95.1 million\n- 2018: $97.2 million\n- 2017: $80.0 million\n\nWe don't have enough data from the provided table to accurately answer without either more information on the start values of these assets at the beginning of 2017 or the breakdowns of the assets.\n\nLet's instead consider what is given about starting values and their amortization explanation for an approximation based on provided figures.\n\nHowever, my initial thought about needing further breakdowns to accurately determine total accumulated amortization as of June 30, 2017 was misguided. Given we must rely on the numbers provided for the answer, a correct approach to using the numbers given them might consider understanding we're using the end value of accumulated amortization that is directly stated in relation to the assets for each year, knowing the lists of assets for each category.\n\nThe actual formula needed here seems not directly provided but understanding each year's total would incorporate these year's ending accumulated amortization totals, then applying that to retrospective annual addition:\n\nAccumulated Amortization (June 30, 2017) = (Accumulated Amortization, June 30, 2018) + Accumulated Amortization (June 30, 2019) would mean looking at how much has accumulated by June 30 of each year and adding those totals:\n\nBut to give an accurate answer directly as requested, we do indeed need the numbers but given we do not have explicit net asset values before these dates, our calculations directly would include what was accumulated as of the end of 2017.\n\nThus, given provided information:\n$95.1 million + $97.2 million = $192.3 million for 2019 and 2018 accumulated as of those dates. $80.0 million was accumulated by June 30, 2017, according to the provided data.\n\nSince specific values and comprehensive breakdowns are not provided, we are directly given figures to work with, and my initial premise was to derive an answer but the information presented appears to support answering using what's explicitly mentioned.\n\nIn direct terms from the question to have a direct equation based directly on provided information without additional assumptions:\nGiven $80 million for 2017, $97.2 million for 2018, and $95.1 million for 2019, we sum those for a flawed misunderstanding in application, thus:\n\nTotal Accumulated as of 2017 = Total for 2018 + Total for 2019?\n\nSince we're calculating for an ending balance:\n$80 million + $95.1 million + $97.2 million = $272.3 million\n\nThis method does not apply if considering the incremental approach that's more precise without direct line items, so:\nThe better interpretation of our need is to look at the fact that for June 30, 2017, given data:\nWe should look at what we can calculate from the data:\nGiven information about the start and end balance for each category or cumulative over the period would not be present in the provided text to use for exact totals without starting point data.\n\nTherefore, since our data doesn't explicitly support calculating the 'total accumulated for 2017' as per the question's direct request for June 30, 2017 without specific numbers for the starting 2017 values, we might err without additional data.\n\nHowever, my consideration was asking for an inference or use of data not provided without assuming values not directly given.\n\nTo maintain accuracy:\nThe approach to answer as requested considering standard accounting practice and direct information would be:\nThe data to answer about total accumulated for June 30, 2017 as requested, appears misunderstood or incorrectly analyzed without equation directly provided in the prompt or the explicit starting accumulation by the year-end given.\n\nGiven provided information, and considering standard accounting practices, the precise calculation directly as requested without additional assumptions appears to be a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of given figures and data.\n\nGiven we still must clarify:\nWe should note the context given points towards an understanding of asset valuation at year-end, without which specific year accumulation without initial values cannot be directly calculated.\n\nTo correct interpretation and provide an equation or calculation method directly supported:\nWe need to identify the exclusion of exact accumulated figures as directly provided in the text for the question asked.\n\n</think>\n<answer> $80 million </answer>", "pred_extracted": "$80 million", "status": "mismatch", "method": "judge", "judge": {"decision": "not_equal", "confidence": 0.99, "rationale": "Ground truth is the numeric value 309; prediction is $80 million (a completely different quantity and unit), so they are not equivalent.", "raw": {"model_text": "{\n  \"decision\": \"not_equal\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.99,\n  \"rationale\": \"Ground truth is the numeric value 309; prediction is $80 million (a completely different quantity and unit), so they are not equivalent.\"\n}", "parsed": {"decision": "not_equal", "confidence": 0.99, "rationale": "Ground truth is the numeric value 309; prediction is $80 million (a completely different quantity and unit), so they are not equivalent."}}, "error": null}}

However, looking at the table provided, we see that there's a breakdown of the expected loss rate and provisions for different categories of receivables.\n\nThe question asks for the loss allowance provision for current receivables, and the table shows a specific breakdown for each category of receivables. Since \"current\" isn't a category that's significantly detailed beyond being part of the larger classification, and the \"Expected loss rate for Current\" is given, we must infer that we are dealing with expected losses rather than the absolute value of the loss provision for current items.\n\nThe loss allowance provision is given directly for each category of past due receivables, but a direct value isn't provided for \"Current.\" However, the expected loss rate for current category is provided in the table. The total expected loss provision isn't given either, so we must use the provided figures for a more straightforward calculation.\n\n\nGiven that the detailed breakdown doesn't provide the specific loss allowance for \"current\" as requested, the direct detail we have for current receivables is merely the rate, not a direct figure to apply. Thus, we must fill the gap using the values given.\n\nFor actual \"Current\" amount to account for, the Gross carrying amount or Net receivables amounts are relevant. Given we do not have the exact figure to apply directly to the calculation requested because the loss allowance details directly don't break down this way, we're notionally missing a step that would pair a specific figure to the loss rate provided.\n\n\nHowever, the loss allowance provision is given as a specific figure for each time frame but does not directly pair to \"Current\" the way we typically would expect in financial reporting. In case we were interpreting the need for an exact figure not provided (a potential oversight based on data), assuming we might need to adjust our interpretation for lack of direct information linking to \"current\" category.\n\nTo stick strictly to the question as it's posed in relation to what data we have: looking at the \"Expected loss rate\" for current (1%) and knowing that loss provisions are summed across categories to reach the total provision, the loss allowance provision for current items, if taking a simplified approach without detailed breakdowns beyond the tabled data and lacking the loss amount specifically for current items, implies a direct request can't be accurately answered from the data given for \"Current\" specifically.\n\n\nThe actual expected loss provision (in terms of numeric value) for just \"Current\" is not calculable based on the data given without further context. The problem as posed does not require a numerical response; however, adhering to the format, we cannot accurately calculate this given the data provided for all categories and their own expected loss provisions without making assumptions that the question may not support.\n\nThus, without the specific loss amount for current receivables, we strictly follow the format but struggle with providing a numerical answer to the specific request about \"Current\" due to the nature of the data provided which seems to break down expected losses across categories but not directly pair those to \"Current\" in a usable or expected manner for the loss provision.\n\n\nConsidering a more direct interpretation we could imply (with the available data given a specific calculation isn't strictly applicable for answering what it seems we're being asked), and sticking to a format that demands an answer, the confusion may arise from how the data is structured: \n\nGiven this structure, without a specific \"Current\" category detail (just a rate and the context that the whole expected loss provision picture is used for managing credit risk which doesn't explicitly pair loss allowance details directly to categories but rather classifies them into groups based on expected loss provision rates):\n\nLet's conclude the calculation process isn't directly stated in a manner that turns into an equation that gives you a figure without interpreting beyond what's given and looking at it strictly as per the prompt: we actually lack the specific data to form a simple calculation that accurately reflects what we're asking for (the loss allowance specifically for current receivables), which would indeed be beneficial if provided.\n\n\n</think>\n\n<answer> 1% * Gross Carrying Amount for Current = 1% * $23,762 = $238 (given in the Loss Allowance Provision column as $238) </answer>", "pred_extracted": "1% * Gross Carrying Amount for Current = 1% * $23,762 = $238 (given in the Loss Allowance Provision column as $238)", "status": "equal", "method": "judge", "judge": {"decision": "equal", "confidence": 0.92, "rationale": "Prediction calculates 1% of $23,762 = $238, matching the ground-truth value 238 exactly.", "raw": {"model_text": "{\n  \"decision\": \"equal\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.92,\n  \"rationale\": \"Prediction calculates 1% of $23,762 = $238, matching the ground-truth value 238 exactly.\"\n}", "parsed": {"decision": "equal", "confidence": 0.92, "rationale": "Prediction calculates 1% of $23,762 = $238, matching the ground-truth value 238 exactly."}}, "error": null}}

This confusion might stem from interpreting how the annual dividend changes are typically accounted for and presented.\n\n- Given the text confusion about what constitutes the year-over-year comparison accurately for the interim dividend, we consider only the provided figures and relate those back to an understanding based on the table's year comparison:\n  Interim dividend in 2019 = 14,801 (in thousands of US$) as directly given, but considering this might not straightforwardly be the \"interim\" for our year-to-year comparison unless the text or table specify otherwise in their presentation.\n\nGiven these considerations and aiming to provide a response with clear connectability to the data provided and focusing on the final dividend mentioned being for a future period and without a clear \"interim\" specified for 2019 for a straightforward year-over-year comparison from the provided table:\n\n- For a calculation strictly sticking to given numbers assuming they are for the most relevant portion of the period under discussion (even though the final dividend declared and its relation might suggest an address of the previous financial year for dividend comparisons):\n\nThe percentage change in dividend amount is calculated by considering the change from 2018 to 2019:\n\n- Let's proceed under the assumption that the figures provided are for comparative analysis and consider the change as a percentage of the original year's dividend amount.\n\nHowever, the initial aim appears to have been slightly misled by not directly using the year-to-year data directly provided and confusion about which dividend is being referred to without year clarity. Thus, we aim to provide the calculation related to the most straightforward comparison available from the information and adjust based on the closest and most straightforward comparison with provided figures and implications:\n\nGiven the information that isn't directly aligned to question-specific requests due to confusion around dividend explanation and how it's being presented:\n\nGiven the explicit year-over-year comparison sought:\n\n<think> \nTo calculate the percentage change from 2018 to 2019 considering the \"interim\" information provided in the table without additional context for clarity but assuming direct relevance:\n- Year 2018: 13,099 (in thousands of US$).\n- Year 2019: 14,801 (in thousands of US$).\n\nChange calculation: [(14,801 - 13,099) / 13,099] * 100 = (1,702 / 13,099) * 100.\n\n\n<answer> Calculation Result: <think>\n((14,801 - 13,099) / 13,099) * 100 = (1,702 / 13,099) * 100 = 0.1292 * 100 = 12.92%\n</think> \n\nGiven this calculation aims to approximate the change from one year to the next based on the data provided:\n- A more accurate formula would consider precisely which figures are being compared for a true \"interim\" or final dividend change over time and understand how these are accounted for according to policy.\n- The answer is specifically focused on the change in the number provided and to be seen as calculated as best from the data without specific diversions or further interpretations.\n\n</think> \n\n<answer> Calculation Result: \n((14,801 - 13,099) / 13,099) * 100 = 12.92% \n</answer>", "pred_extracted": "Calculation Result: <think>\n((14,801 - 13,099) / 13,099) * 100 = (1,702 / 13,099) * 100 = 0.1292 * 100 = 12.92%\n</think> \n\nGiven this calculation aims to approximate the change from one year to the next based on the data provided:\n- A more accurate formula would consider precisely which figures are being compared for a true \"interim\" or final dividend change over time and understand how these are accounted for according to policy.\n- The answer is specifically focused on the change in the number provided and to be seen as calculated as best from the data without specific diversions or further interpretations.\n\n</think> \n\n<answer> Calculation Result: \n((14,801 - 13,099) / 13,099) * 100 = 12.92%", "status": "mismatch", "method": "judge", "judge": {"decision": "not_equal", "confidence": 0.93, "rationale": "The prediction gives 12.92% while the ground truth is 12.99; the numeric values differ (by 0.07 percentage points), so they are not equivalent.", "raw": {"model_text": "{\n  \"decision\": \"not_equal\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.93,\n  \"rationale\": \"The prediction gives 12.92% while the ground truth is 12.99; the numeric values differ (by 0.07 percentage points), so they are not equivalent.\"\n}", "parsed": {"decision": "not_equal", "confidence": 0.93, "rationale": "The prediction gives 12.92% while the ground truth is 12.99; the numeric values differ (by 0.07 percentage points), so they are not equivalent."}}, "error": null}}

Instead, we focus on the actual average change or growth rate. The decrease or increase could be viewed as simply the difference, but when talking about averages, the term usually implies a growth or decline. Thus, the actual calculation we're tasked to find appears to be misunderstood given the usual context of such questions, where \"average increase/decrease\" might typically refer to the change over a specific period or the average growth rate. Since the net result was an increase (as 21,189 > 21,417), we simply acknowledge this increase but for a clear \"average,\" we'd indeed calculate it as the total increase over the period. Given the format of the data, it seems the task might be looking for the confirmation of growth or the rate of increase itself rather than requesting a typical numerical value from a formula representing an \"average\" in a traditional sense. But, strictly following instructions, we'd note that the actual change is a positive 21,189 - 21,417 = -228 decline in the context of how one might normally consider the \"average\" increase when subtracting the number of losses. However, since the task cannot be directly correlated with the standard interpretation of \"average\" and instead appears focused on confirming an increase, we look at it from that perspective. </think>\n\n<answer> Since there's been a misunderstanding in the task's framing regarding \"average increase/decrease,\" to clarify the point, we must interpret the question as seeking the recognition of the increase rather than a calculated \"average.\" The question's phrasing (\"What was the average increase / (decrease) in internet service customers between 2018 and 2019?\") could be seen as asking for confirmation of the change rather than the arithmetic average of the numbers given. However, to correct any potential confusion and adhere strictly to instructions, the direct mathematical response based on the data provided (which indicates an increase of 21,189 - 21,417 = -228, but in context refers to a positive addition overall) would not be accurate in a strict interpretation without further context on whether one is to focus solely on numerical calculation or acknowledge the message of growth. Thus, clarifying the understanding, if one were to calculate the average change (considering the context and directions provided might indicate what's sought), it seems there's a mix-up in approach. The correct interpretation directly from the instructions seems not to align with calculating an arithmetic average change, but rather an increase/decrease. Thus, focusing on what appears to be intended:\" </answer> The average increase (in terms of change from one year to the next based on provided data and standard understanding of such metrics) isn't directly asked for in terms of arithmetic but in terms of whether one year had more additions than the last. Given that 2019 had 21,189 additions and 2018 had 21,417 additions, focusing on the numeric cells provided directly, the increase or change in this context could misleadingly suggest a need for an answer format reflecting the mathematical possibility rather than the clarity of \"increase\" mentioned. The focus was incorrectly adjusted to imply an \"average\" rather than the actual observed increase, suggesting a clarification is necessary in how one calculates \"change\" between two periods based on provided numbers which indicate an increase but where \"average\" in the context likely aims to indicate the arithmetical mean of numbers (which isn't directly what's being asked but is an understandable misprint considering instructions). </think> \n\n<think> However, since it asks what the \"average increase / (decrease)\" is, the confusion stems from the task's framing and could potentially imply seeking the confirmation of an increase. The question might be asking for confirmation rather than a calculated \"average.\" Given this, and adhering closely to instructions: since there's been confusion in the explanation and the aim might simply be to clarify the growth rather than average, the explanation of an increase and a calculation that highlights the actual number of increases makes sense in this context, even though labeling it as \"average increase/decrease\" could indeed lead to the miscalculation of the intent without clarifying the \"average\" in a mathematical sense or discussing it from a rate of growth perspective (like year-over-year growth rate of the increase). </think>\n\n<think> The key here, based on provided instructions, appears to be clarifying that the question, as asked, might be more about identifying if there was an increase rather than calculating an \"average.\" The increase in internet service customers from 2018 to 2019 is 21,189 - 21,417 = -228, indicating the customers increased by 21,189 - 21,417 more in 2019 than in 2018, not a year-over-year \"average increase\" in a specific percentage. For clarity on the data given, though: the words \"average increase / (decrease)\" suggest an error in communication based on how such data is typically analyzed (focusing on \"average\" could conflate with \"growth rate\" in a misinterpretation). The task's apparent attempt is to clarify the numerical change, not the percentage or arithmetic mean of the years provided.

However, interpreting the wishes or expectations given, without more precise details, such as the expected format or specifics regarding \"average,\" and considering common presentations of this type, we might clarify the direction as seeking the change's magnitude or confirmation of increase rather than the average change, which seems not directly the intention based on given metrics and usual discussion structures. The confusion stems from the request itself which implies numerical calculation or observation of change rather than the usual arithmetic calculation intended by \"average.\" The clear interpretation given the context should perhaps notice the numerical increase or growth rate but seems misframed in terms of what's directly requested by the query without further specification. </think>\n\n<answer> Given the potential confusion and focusing strictly on the direct data provided (and assuming a focus on clarification of the numerical aspects which might be obscured by the request's framing): the numerical change from 2018 to 2019 in internet service customers is an increase of 21,189 - 21,417.

However, the overall trend is an increase in revenue, suggesting that the growth in certain regions outweighed the declines.\nSo, to reason out the cause of the revenue increase, we can see that the overall growth came from a combination of factors such as an increase in the offshore and service businesses and specific geographic regions showing substantial growth.\n\nHowever, looking at the table, the actual value of revenue in the text is provided in millions of euros, and the growth rate in the table is 12%. \nSince this growth rate is 12%, to calculate the exact amount increase in revenue we multiply the original value by 12/100. Given a 12% increase and assuming 9,122 million euros for 2018, \n(9,122 * 12)/100 = 109,764 million euros or 10,376.8 million euros which seems slightly higher than the 10,227 million euros provided in the table for 2019, likely due to rounding in the percentage increase or differences in the values given.\nHowever, we do not need to calculate this precisely to determine the reason for the increase but rather understand the growth factors.\n\nConsidering the factors leading to the revenue increase:\n1. Growth in the offshore business.\n2. Growth in the service business.\n3. Growth in Europe, C. I. S., Africa, Middle East.\n\nThe question requires the reason for the increase, which is a combination of these factors but most particularly highlighted in the growth of specific sectors and regions.\n\n</think>\n\n<answer> Growth in the offshore and service businesses and clear growth in the onshore business. </answer>", "pred_extracted": "Growth in the offshore and service businesses and clear growth in the onshore business.", "status": "mismatch", "method": "judge", "judge": {"decision": "not_equal", "confidence": 0.9, "rationale": "Prediction only repeats business-segment growth (offshore, service, onshore) and omits key points: overall significant year-over-year revenue increase and the geographic breakdown (substantial rises in Europe/CIS/Africa/Middle East and declines in the other two regions).", "raw": {"model_text": "{\n  \"decision\": \"not_equal\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"rationale\": \"Prediction only repeats business-segment growth (offshore, service, onshore) and omits key points: overall significant year-over-year revenue increase and the geographic breakdown (substantial rises in Europe/CIS/Africa/Middle East and declines in the other two regions).\"\n}", "parsed": {"decision": "not_equal", "confidence": 0.9, "rationale": "Prediction only repeats business-segment growth (offshore, service, onshore) and omits key points: overall significant year-over-year revenue increase and the geographic breakdown (substantial rises in Europe/CIS/Africa/Middle East and declines in the other two regions)."}}, "error": null}}

The text mentions that \"$0.9 million in costs incurred during fiscal year 2018 related to the relocation of the Company's tantalum powder facility equipment from Carson City, Nevada to its existing Matamoros, Mexico plant were reclassified from “Plant start-up costs” to “Restructuring charges” during fiscal year 2019.\" This implies that the total costs related to the relocation, or at least a part of it, are mentioned in the context of fiscal years 2018 and 2019, specifically with regards to costs moved from \"Plant start-up costs\" to \"Restructuring charges\". Therefore, the amount related to the relocation that was moved in 2019 is the key figure to find. </think>\n\n<think> However, the provided text and table do not give the exact numbers moving between 2018 to 2019 for the recurring costs. But we do see in the 2019 column under \"Plant start-up costs\" a -$927 (negative value indicates a deduction, possibly an adjustment) and under \"Restructuring charges\" an $8,779. The table doesn't directly provide information on how much costs related to relocation are exactly the same across different years. </think>\n\n<think> Since the amount and how much costs were cost incurred in 2018 but then adjusted or moved are not specified beyond the relocation costs and the noting of adjustment in the text, we use the provided totals as a basis for the calculation if any given adjustments and costs are to directly impact 2018 figures.

We know some of these were moved and are included in the provided financial records for 2019.
