Overall interest expense (excluding capitalized interest) in 2019 was $1,952 million, an increase of $473 million year to year.\"\n\n3.

For machinery and equipment, which typically have a useful life of 3 to 15 years, we would use the lower figure to simplify the calculation.\n\nTo calculate the straight-line depreciation for a given asset:\n\n1. Determine the depreciable base (cost of the asset minus any residual value)  \n2. Divide the depreciable base by the estimated useful life of the asset\n\nFor 50-year buildings and building improvements:  \nDepreciable base = $81.2 - $0.8 = $80.4  \nAnnual depreciation = $80.4 / 50 = $1.608 million\n\nFor 15-year machinery and equipment:  \nAnnual depreciation = $390.7 / 15 = $26.046 million\n\nHowever, these calculations are incorrect because they don't reflect the actual depreciation schedule used in calculations as $27.2 million and $22.0 million for 2019 and 2017 respectively states an actual method where $80.4 / 50 = $1.608 million and $390.7 / 15 = $26.046 million are used, respectively. The straight-line method for long-term assets quickly results in depreciation being very small. The depreciation rate per year can be calculated by subtracting the accrued depreciation from the current year's depreciation expense, and then dividing by the years remaining in the asset's useful life to get the rate per year. For example, in 2019 depreciation would be $80.4 million / 50 years = $1.608 million a year...  </think>\n\n<answer> The depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, which is applied over the useful life of the asset. For buildings and building improvements, it's calculated as $80.4 million divided by the estimated useful life of 50 years, which gives a rate per year of $1.608 million. For machinery and equipment, it's calculated as $390.7 million divided by the estimated useful life of 15 years, which gives a rate per year of $26.046 million. When calculating the actual annual depreciation expense, it would start as the depreciable base of $80.4 million, then subtract the accrued depreciation of $27.2 million from the current year's $22.5 million expense, yielding an actual annual depreciation rate of $22.5 million / (50 - (17 years remaining)) or $22.5 million / 33 years, leading to a depreciation rate of $675,757 per year as a more accurate calculation. </answer>", "pred_extracted": "The depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, which is applied over the useful life of the asset.
