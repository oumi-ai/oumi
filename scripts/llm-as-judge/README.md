# LLM as Judge

This script is used to evaluate the performance of an LLM as a judge. It uses the `oumi` library to generate prompts for a given input and then judges the response for a specific attribute.

## Requirements

In addition to the `oumi` library, the following libraries are required:

```bash
pip install gspread openai
```
